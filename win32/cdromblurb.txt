Welcome to the C. elegans Acedb database CD-ROM distribution.

Please note that this is an experimental release, made on
7th January 2000. Please ensure that it has not been superceded
before using it.

This installation program will install both the Acedb software
and, when that is complete, the C. Elegans database. If you wish 
to install only one of these components (for instance if you
already have the Acedb software installed) then click the 
Cancel button now and use the separate installation programs 
on this CD-ROM

Acedb.exe - to install the acedb software.
Wormace.exe - to install the C. Elegans data.

If you wish to install both components, click the next button,
which will take you first through installing the Acedb 
software, and then the C. Elegans data.
