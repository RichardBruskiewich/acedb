A new (empty) acedb database has been created, 
probably on c:\Acedb Databases\New Database, unless
you asked for a diferent location.

The behavior of an acedb database in controlled by
a myriad of control files which can be found in
c:\Acedb Databases\New Database\wspec. Double-click
on them to browse or edit.

The most important file is models.wrm, which controls
the schema of the data held by Acedb. The models.wrm file
which is currently in your database is the one used by 
the C. Elegans database. You may want to edit it and 
use the "Read models" function before adding any data.

If you are unable to gain write access to your acedb
database, look in passwd.wrm and add you usename there.
(If you don't have a username use the GetLoginFailed option.)
