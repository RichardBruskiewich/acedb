<H1>ACEDB for Microsoft Windows</H1>

<P>This document provides &quot;platform-specific&quot; documentation on the installation,
configuration and operation of ACEDB for the Microsoft Windows '95 ('98) or NT (4.0)
(formerly also called 'WinAce', however, 'WinAce' was recently discovered <B>not</B> to be 
the name for several software applications on the WWW! Therefore, <STRONG>'ACEDB for Windows'</STRONG>
is now the official name of this software). 
Development work on ACEDB for Windows is ongoing at the Sanger Centre.

<A NAME="Background"></A><H2>Background</H2>

<P>Welcome to the home page for the (Intel box) Microsoft Windows version of the
&quot;A Caenorhabditis elegans Database (ACEDB)&quot; software. ACEDB is a 
multi-platform supported, object-oriented
scientific database engine specialized for the management and representation of genomic data 
(maps and sequences) and associated biological (including bibliographical) data. ACEDB has
deep knowledge about the biological nature of the data it stores and has a very rich
interactive graphical representation of such data.</P>

<P>This readme provides platform specific details on
how to set up a ACEDB for Windows ('WinAce') database upon your PC. It does NOT dwell upon the complete 
details of operating ACEDB per say (WinAce is by and large almost identical to the well 
established UNIX versions of the program). Rather, for further details on ACEDB, novice
 users are directed towards to consult the rich available documentation resource about 
ACEDB on the WWW at:</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="Requirements"></A><H2>System Requirements</H2>
<A NAME="Basic_Hardware"></A>
<H3>Basic Hardware:</H3>

<P>This program should run on any WIN32 O/S compatible Intel Pentium microprocessor based personal computer 
 with the recommended base amount of RAM and hard drive storage; however, 
ACEDB was designed (under UNIX) to expect a bountiful memory space which 
it exploits with abandon (JTM) so more RAM is better (shoot for 32 - 64 mb, 
or better, depending upon the size of your database).
The ACEDB database will require essentially the same hard drive space as 
currently publicized for UNIX versions.</P>

<P><A NAME="Video_Graphics_Hardware"></A>
<H3>Video Graphics Hardware:</H3>

<P>The program requires a minimum of 256 color VGA; 800 x 600 pixels is a desired MINIMUM screen resolution. 
WinAce now runs well under larger color palettes (i.e. 64K or &quot;True Color&quot; palettes); The graphics 
DEFINITELY works better upon higher pixel resolution displays and larger monitors. This writer now runs the 
software upon a 1600 x 1200 pixel display on a 19&quot; monitor, with very appealing results. Running the 
program at lower resolutions is found to be progressively less satisfying, with great disappointment at 
640 x 480 VGA bordering on frustration. Moral of the story: get the highest resolution mode possible 
running upon your machine.</P>

<P><A NAME="Ancillary_Hardware"></A>
<H3>Ancillary Hardware:</H3>

<P>Other than the standard windows mouse, the program doesn't absolutely rely upon any &quot;special&quot; 
peripherals and inherits its computing functionality (i.e. printing and networking) from the Windows O/S. </P>

<A NAME="Installation_and_Configuration"></A>
<H2>Program Installation and Configuration</H2>

<P>This section outlines ACEDB configuration details under Windows.</P>

<H3>*** STEP 1 - Decide where you want to put your database</H3>

<P> You need to provide the program with the path name location of your database. The basic ACEDB database 
directory structure is as follows:</P>
<font size="2">
<Pre>
\acedb ---|-- database----| ; (required) location of the  binary database
     	|		|-- new ; (created by ACEDB) used to collect update log
     	|		|-- touched ; (created) used to collect changes log
     	|-- wspec    ; (required) location of the *.wrm configuration files
     	|-- rawdata  ; (optional) location of.ace or (mandatory) update files
		 	 	specified by the ACEDB_DATA environment variable
     	|-- whelp    ; (optional) location of HTML files (online help, etc.)
     	|-- wscript  ; (optional) command line scripts, perl, etc. 
     	|-- pictures ; optional - for *.jpg, *.gif pictures, etc.
 </pre>
</font>

<P>Specify the latter &quot;pictures&quot; directory as an additional (semi-colon delimited) 
path value in the ACEDB environment variable (see below).</P>
<P>\acedb can be ANY path name you like, but you must ensure that you start
the program from within that directory, provide a full path to the directory,
<B>OR</B> set the ACEDB  environment variable (see below) is set to this path name.</P>

<H3>*** STEP 2 - Obtain programs and data</H3>

<P>The most recent updates for this program may generally be obtained by anonymous ftp from the Sanger Centre or NCBI:</P>
<P align="center"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/acedb/winace">
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/acedb/winace</A></P>
<P align="center">or</P>
<P align="center"><A HREF="ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/acedb/winace">
ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/acedb/winace</A></P>
<P>
Previous releases (4.5.6 or earlier) were Winzip self extracting archives. The current releases use
the Gnu gzip and UNIX style tar facilities, which you should be able to extract using either Gnu tools or
using Winzip or similar utilities. Extract these files into a suitable subdirectory (e.g. your c:\acedb\bin)
<B>AND</B> ensure that that subdirectory is entered onto your Windows program 'PATH' (i.e. in the
'Environment' tab of the Systems applet in the Windows Control Panel...).
</P>
<P>
For those of you upgrading from release 4.5.6 or earlier versions of ACEDB for Windows, it is well advised
to use the Add/Remove applet in the Windows Control Panel to remove any such previous WinAce version, prior
to attempting to run the new program.
</P>
<P><STRONG>Note that from October 1999 onwards, ACEDB for Windows is a
new version built upon cross-platform software tools spanning UNIX/Windows (and possibly Mac's)
(see the <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Acedb/CurrentWinAce.shtml">
current release information page</A>) which is essentially identical in look and feel to its UNIX variant,
hence, the graphical version is now called 'xace' (the UNIX graphical version name) rather than 'winace'.
Of course, 'tace' refers to the non-graphical version of ACEDB (as in UNIX).</STRONG>
</P>
<A NAME="SOFTWARE_LOCATION"></A>
<H3>*** STEP 3 - Obtain Database Schema and Data</H3>

<P>It is assumed that users of the software will separately obtain the required configuration and data files
 essential for running ACEDB (as in the UNIX version); however, a copy of the current C. elegans wspec 
configuration files may be &quot;custom&quot; installed during WinAce setup. </P>
<P>Databases must be reconstructed from scratch by loading update* or .ace files into an initialized 
database. Any model schema, display specs, etc. currently debugged on a UNIX system should work fine 
within WIN32, with no modifications. The most important thing is to ensure that a &quot;wspec&quot; 
subdirectory (e.g. c:\acedb\wspec) is created and all the *.wrm configuration files are placed in 
this &quot;wspec&quot; subdirectory. The &quot;database&quot; directory (e.g. c:\acedb\database) 
must also be created prior to first execution of the program.</P>
<P>For Caenorhabditis elegans, the full current release of update* files may be obtained by 
anonymous ftp from:</P>
<P align="center"><A HREF="ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/acedb/celegans">
ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/acedb/celegans</A></P>
<P>Consult your system documentation on ftp details (or use a WWW browser). 
Again, the files will be compressed (as UNIX update*.tar.Z files). Although 
these are UNIX files, the shareware WinZip program :-) is fully equipped to extract such archives. 
Simply place the .tar.Z file in your designated primary directory (e.g. c:\acedb) then 
extract the entire archive using WinZip. WinZip should create a &quot;wspec&quot; and 
&quot;rawdata&quot; subdirectory for the configuration and dataset (update*) files 
respectively, plus any other files in the update. Should you experience difficulties 
in reading the update files, please verify that you have made a proper unix to dos 
translation of the files. Using the update (uncompressed, untar'd) files off unix 
sometimes causes problems, as do update files ftp'd using some (older) utility programs.</P>
<P>Unix to DOS Conversions: As many folks will know, UNIX and DOS have different 
conventions for file structure, in particular, the end of line (EOL) character(s) 
in files. Some difficulties may be experienced when using UNIX files (such as wspec 
or update files) in the Windows/DOS world. The extent that this causes malfunctions
 within ACEDB for Windows has not yet been fully assessed. On UNIX machines, a 
&quot;unix2dos&quot; utility program may be available which converts unix (text) 
files into DOS formatted files (and vice versa, using dos2unix). This program should 
be used when transferring most (text) files such as wspec and update files from Unix 
to Windows/DOS. Alternatively, &quot;tar&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; compress your files 
on the UNIX machine then use the WinZip utility (or other similar utility) which works
 properly with tar.Z files on PC's) to extract the files onto your PC (Note: this is 
probably the preferred approach).</P>
<P>Special Note: Windows FTP may inadvertently rename files (i.e. substitute &quot;_&quot;
 for &quot;.&quot; In the file names). This can be a source of problems during standard 
(Unix) update file extraction. Users should rename files back to their original names 
if this occurs, then extract the &quot;.z&quot; files using Winzip (or equivalent) by specifying 
the proper &quot;.tar&quot; archive name, i.e. &quot;update.WS4.4-1.tar.z&quot; should be called
 &quot;update.WS4.4-1.tar&quot;. Then, extract the update files into your primary database directory.</P>
<U>Loading Large C.elegans Update Files</U>: Rumors from the field (David Baillie, SFU) suggest 
that you can speed up your database creation/update process by locating the rawdata\update* 
(or .ace) files on an independent physical (not merely logical) hard drive distinct from the 
one upon which you are creating your binary database (e.g.. the hard drive containing your
 c:\acedb\database and c:\acedb\wspec directories). This avoids the time lags of hard drive 
read/write head &quot;thrashing&quot; associated with ACEDB reading a data object from the 
rawdata\update then writing it out to a binary database\blockx.wrm file the same physical device.</P>

<H3>*** STEP 4 - Program Configuration</H3>

<P>After the programs have been installed on a user's machine, some program icons will have 
been installed in the Windows &quot;Start Menu&quot;; however, they are not guaranteed to 
work perfectly unless correctly configured, as follows. Please review these details
 carefully and make the necessary changes to your database configuration files (under wspec) 
and to your tace and winace &quot;Start Menu&quot; shortcut icons.</P>

<H4>Write Access:</H4>

<P>For write access to the database (essential for database creation!), ACEDB consults 
the wspec\passwrd.wrm configuration. </P>
<P>You should ensure that this file lists all write permitted computer user names. NOTE: 
Check this file after you WinZip extract new updates, in case the your passwrd.wrm gets 
overwritten with another update* copy... </P>
<P>For Windows '95 (which doesn't care about user accounts), add &quot;acedb&quot; as the 
user name. For Windows NT, you should put the actual user account name(s) of all users to
 whom you wish to grant write permission (e.g. &quot;Administrator&quot; if that is your
 NT account).</P>

<H4>Environment Parameter Settings:</H4>

<P>The following environment variables may be so set:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ACEDB: Set to the pathname of your primary subdirectory (e.g. c:\acedb) plus any 
ancillary search directories (i.e. for image files). UNC names (i.e. \\&lt;hostname\&lt;path&gt;) 
are NOT yet supported; however, mapping a drive letter to an UNC path then using the drive 
letter root path (i.e. x:\ where &quot;x&quot; is the mapped drive letter) should work.
 There are, however, peculiarities in LAN access permissions that may cause problems 
(see &quot;Networking&quot; in this document).</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Miscellaneous Configuration Items:</H4>

<U>'wspec' Files</U>

<P>The &quot;wspec&quot; subdirectory contains *.wrm configuration files (some self documenting) 
which may be customized for better operation of ACEDB in general and WinAce in particular.</P>
<P>By and large, the *.wrm files obtained from a UNIX ACEDB database will port directly, with few 
modifications, to WinAce; however, there are a few *.wrm which are best readjusted to the WinAce 
environment,specifically:</P>
<UL>
<LI>options.wrm - controls the number and order of classes displayed in the ACEDB main window 
(see also layout.wrm)</LI>
<LI>displays.wrm - controls the default size and location of ACEDB display windows (note: some
 ACEDB windows such as the main class display window are text font size sensitive. Changing 
the default width and height	of such windows for WinAce may be helpful, especially after font changes (below))</LI>
</UL>

<H3>*** STEP 5 - Initializing and Loading the Database ***</H3>

<P>Once you have configured the database, double click your shortcut icon to load the program. 
The first time it is loaded (and everytime you delete the database\ACEDB.wrm file for your 
database), the program will encounter an &quot;empty&quot; database and ask your permission 
to (re-)initialize the database. </P>
<P>Say Yes! The database models will then be loaded and the database (re-)constructed.</P>
<P>Once initialized, the database will be empty. To load a large standard dataset (e.g. C.
 elegans data) into the database, you have two options (A or B):</P>

<P><B>Option A.</B>	Execute a &quot;Add Update File&quot;: from the ACEDB main window 
pop-up menu. This method uses a formal &quot;update&quot; file such as the C.elegans 
update* files. At present, we have occasional problems with this method: sometimes the 
UNIX source files have a read error (not reproducible in all contexts...) and the system 
may also crash at the end of the session; however, it is the preferred method for 
C.elegans (and other projects issuing such updates). </P>

<P><B>Option B.</B>Execute the following sequence of operations (which simulates the 
&quot;Add Update&quot; 
operations) invoked from the main window popup menu:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Read models</LI>
<LI>Read .ace files</LI>
<LI>Align maps (click on all the buttons for all the types of alignments...)</LI>
<LI>Save the changes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Note: you should ensure that all your input data files are renamed to 	have the &quot;.ace&quot; 
file extension, in order for them to be visible by the file open dialog box for &quot;Read .ace&quot; files.</P>
<P>If you are loading a non-standard dataset (not structured as an &quot;update&quot; file format)
 then use Option &quot;B&quot;. You can also input data directly into the database using the main 
window popup menu &quot;Add-Alias-Rename&quot; command, or by using the &quot;Update&quot; menu 
command while inside a tree graph object display.</P>

<H3>*** STEP 6 - Use the Database ***</H3>

<P>The database should now be fully operational. General 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Acedb/">ACEDB documentation</A> should be consulted 
for further details.</P>
<P>The recommended way to start ACEDB for Windows up from the command line is to change directory
into your database directory, then run the program, giving the current directory ('.') as the path, e.g.</P>
<PRE>

    c:\>       cd c:\acedb
    c:\acedb\> xace .

</PRE>
<P>(Substitute 'tace' for 'xace' if you wish to run the textonly version of the software).</P>
<P>ACEDB for Windows should behave more or less like the UNIX version, with reasonable performance, 
except as noted below.</P>
