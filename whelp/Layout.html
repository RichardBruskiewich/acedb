<H1>Class Layout</H1>

The user can configure which classes are displayed in the main window
for immediate selection. The configuration file <B>wspec/layout.wrm</B>
holds this information in simple text format. The user may decide
which classes he/she most frequently accesses and arrange them into
groups etc..<P>

The "Class Layout Editor" is effectivly a graphical editor for this
configuration. Click on the "Set Selection" button in the main window
to start the editor.<P>

In the yellow area the classes are displayed in the same layout
as in the main class window. You can click on any class-name and drag it
to a new position in the text grid.<BR>
Below the line are the remaining visible classes which can also be
used for the default. Most often these left-over classes
belong to the system, but they may be of interest to some users.
The classes "KeySet" and "Model" are usually included in the class 
layout.</BR>
You can pick up one of these classes and drag it into the yellow area
to position it in the layout.<BR>
To remove a class from the layout, just drag its name below the
line into the area of the remaining classes.<P>


<h3>Menu items:</h3>

write access to the wspec directory and you have made any unsaved
