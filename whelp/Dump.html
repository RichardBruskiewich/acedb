<h2>Dump all</h2>

<p>Dumps the whole database into an ace file. 
This function is synonymous with "Export" in other applications.

<p>The dump file can be edited by hand, parsed back in an empty system
(provided you split out the copy of the tags and classes files) or use
with acediff to compare 2 sessions.

<p>At the same time, Dump checks the integrity of the whole database and
verifies the existence of all the XREF's.

<p>The "Dump" function dumps all the Visible A and B (not X) classes. This 
information is sufficient for a complete reconstruction.

<p>Acedb dumps out the objects as it knows them now.  Uncommitted changes
will be dumped - so the user can parse a file in, make a full dump, then quit
without saving.
Objects have to be saved though - if the object is still being parsed or 
edited then it will dump the old version.

<p>Note that if you delete a tag(s) in the model (by editting models.wrm) and then
dump, the tags will still be dumped if they exist in the database. You will then
<B>NOT</B> be able to read the dump file back in unless you either:
<UL>
  <LI>return models.wrm to its original state (i.e. reinsert the delete tags)
  <LI>remove all instances of the deleted tags from the dump file(s).
</UL>
Acedb works like this to prevent the accidental loss of potentially large
amounts of data that might result from unintentional editting of models.wrm.
The recommended way to remove a tag is to remove all instances from the database
first and then remove the tag from models.wrm.
