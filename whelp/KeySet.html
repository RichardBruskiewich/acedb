<h2>The ACeDB Keyset Window</h2>
<em>Help page wrtten by Martin Aslett, August 1997</em>

<P>

As of version 4.5 of ACeDB, the KeySet window has been substantially
modified in order to increase ease of use and to subdivide the
pulldown menu into related submenus.

<P>

The arrowheaded bar on the left of the window acts a scroll bar. The
user may click on the arrowheads to scroll up and down the keyset a
page at a time or alternatively drag the green rectangle up and down
the scroll bar to scroll more quickly through large keysets.  <P>


Multiple items in the keyset may now be selected by single clicking on
them one by one or for items grouped together in the keyset by
clicking on the first or last item in the group and dragging the mouse
over the other items. Selected items are indicated by a grey
background.  <P>


The buttons at the top of the display allow access to a range of pull
down menus and functions to be performed on the keyset. All pulldown
menus are accessed by clicking and holding down the right hand mouse
button whilst the pointer is over the appropriate button. The buttons
are in order :-


<H4>Show As</H4> This button can be used either as a pulldown menu or
simply by clicking it to toggle through its options. It allows the
user to control how objects in the keyset will be displayed if they
are clicked on. The basic options are 'Text' to display as text or
'Graph' to produce the default display set in the 
<A HREF="Class_Configuration.html">options.wrm</A> file using the
<CODE>-Display</CODE> option.


<H4>Biblio</H4>
Clicking this button brings up the <A href="Biblio.html">Biblio display</A> window for the keyset.


<H4>More Info</H4>
Clicking this button brings up the <A href="Forest.html">Forest display</A> for the keyset.


<H4>Quit</H4>
Clicking this button quits the keyset window.



<H4>Query</H4>
This button may be used either to produce a pulldown menu for the
keyset (containing items related to querying the keyset) or can simply
be clicked upon. In the latter case, a text box appears below the
button allowing the user to perform a command line query on the
keyset.<P>


If used as a pulldown menu, there are currently options :-<P>


<B>Query</B> - Lets the user perform a command line query as with
clicking on the button.  <BR><B>Follow</B> - Brings up a tag chooser
window for the keyset, allowing the user to perform the 'follow' query
command on one of the tags (i.e. to produce a keyset containing all
instances of that tag linked to by items in the keyset).  <BR><B>Find
neighbours</B> - Finds all objects in the database referred to by
items currently in the keyset.  <BR><B>Query by Example</B> - Allows
the user to perform a 'Query by Example' on the keyset.
<H4>Select/Modif</H4> This button allows the user to bring up a
pulldown menu containing options related to editing and copying of the
keyset. The menu options are as follows :-<P>


<B>Add/remove items one by one</B> - Allows the user to add or remove
items from the keyset one by one. Double clicking an item in the
keyset removes it. Double clicking an item in another keyset adds it
to the current keyset.
<BR><B>New empty keyset</B> - Allows the user to create a new empty
keyset window.  <BR><B>Copy whole keyset</B> - Copies the whole keyset
into another keyset window.  <BR><B>Save current keyset as</B> - Only
available if the user has write access. Allows the user to save the
keyset as an item in the KeySet class of the database.  <BR><B>Select
All</B> - Selects the whole keyset.  <BR><B>Clear selection</B> -
Deselects all selected items.  <BR><B>Reverse selection</B> -

items.  <BR><B>Remove selected items</B> - Removes all selected items
from the keyset.  <BR><B>Copy selected items</B> - Copies the selected
items to a new keyset.

<H4>Export</H4> This button allows the user to bring up a pulldown
menu containing options for exporting and mailing the objects in the
keyset in various formats. Choosing each option calls up a new window
allowing the user to save the data into a file of the appropriate type
or click a 'Mail' button to mail the file to an e-mail address. The
various options are as follows :- <P>


<B>ace file</B> - Exports the keyset data as a standard .ace file.
<BR><B>ace file with timestamps</B> - Exports the data as a .ace file with timestamps included.
<BR><B>list of names</B> - Exports the names of the data items in the keyset as an item of the Keyset class in .ace file format. 
<BR><B>DNA in FASTA format</B> - Exports DNA from any sequence objects in the keyset in FASTA format.
<BR><B>Protein in FASTA format</B> - Exports peptide sequence from any protein objects in the keyset in FASTA format.
<BR><B>Protein alignment</B> - Exports protein sequence alignments for any sequences in the keyset.

<H4>Other</H4>
Clicking this button displays or hides three other buttons on the keyset window :-
<P>

<B>Combine</B> - produces a pulldown menu allowing logical operations
to be performed on two keyset windows. The operators are as follows
:-<P>


OR - takes the union of the two sets<BR>
AND - takes the intersection of the two sets<BR>
MINUS - removes any item contained by the second keyset form the first<BR>
XOR - results in the exclusive OR of the two sets (i.e items in one of the keysets but not in both).

<P>

of each item in the keyset.  <P>

In addition to the menus available from the buttons at the top of the
window, the KeySet window has a main pulldown menu (reached by
clicking anywhere on the window except on the buttons. Most of the
options are duplicates of those available from the other pulldown
menus but the following options are only available from the main menu
