<H1> Acedb user guide: tace </H1>

<STRONG>tace</STRONG> is a command line interface to acedb.
To start tace, set the environment variable ACEDB to point
to your database directory and simply type
<PRE>
 % tace 
</PRE>
You can also override the environment setting and specify the
database directory as the first command line argument :
<PRE>
 % tace /home/wormdb
</PRE>

The program will then open up the database and show the tace prompt
"acedb&gt;". The fundamental concept in tace is the notion of an 
<B>active KeySet</B>. A KeySet is a list of objects, which can be
operated upon. The user could use a query to select a set of objects
for the active keyset and then apply an edit command to all those 
objects.<P>
The next chapter list the possible commands that can be typed
after the prompt.<BR>
(command options inside [brackets] are optional, the vertical bar '|' indicates a choice of possible options, words in <I>italics</I> are values specified by the user.)<BR>
All commands can be abbreviated to a certain point where they become
ambigious. Command are not case-sensitive.

<H2>Commands</H2>


<DL>
<DT><B>Quit</B></DT>
  <DD>Exits the program without saving any changes.</DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>Classes</B></DT>
  <DD>Give a list of all the visible class names and how many objects they contain. <BR>
      See the document on <A HREF="Class_Configuration.html">Class
      Configuration</A> to learn how the visibility of classes
      can be configured.
  </DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>Show [-h | -a | -p | -j] [-T] [-b <I>begin</I>] [-c <I>max</I>] [-f <I>filename</I>]  [-C] [[-t] <I>tag</I>] </B></DT>
   <DD>
   Shows the objects in the active set.<BR>
   -T shows time stamps<BR>
   -C ignore comments</BR>
   </DD>
   <P>

<DT><B>Table-Maker <I>options</I></B></DT>
   <DD>This command has a number of options that can be used to load/execute/manipulate 
       <A HREF="Table_Maker.html">table-maker</A> definitions. The order of
       options is important, not all options are valid with every mode of use.

       <P><B>-active</B> : run the query over the active keyset
	    rather than the whole class of column 1 of the definitions.</P>
	    

       <P><B>-j | -p | -h | -a</B> : use either of these options to display the
          result table in one of the formats in the familiar choice of 
	  Java/Perl/Human-readable/Acedb respectively</P>

       <P><B>-o <I>outfile</I></B> : the result table will be written
           to the specified file, rather than to the screen.</P>

       <P><B>-b <I>start</I></B> : specify the start-point in the range 
           of the calculation over the first column.</P>

       <P><B>-c <I>max</I></B> : maximum number of objects to be included
           in the calculation of the first column. If there are 200
	   objects in column 1 you can range over objects 100 to 150
	   using the options <CODE>-b 100 -c 50</CODE></P>
       
       <P><B>-title</B> : if this option is set, the names of column headers
           are also printed in the output.</P>

       <P><B>-s <I>objname</I></B> : this options saves a table-maker definition
           to the database. The definitions have to be read from a file
           or from an object. No calculations are performed, the program
	   will simply report back saying &quot;<CODE>Table saved</CODE>&quot;.
	   The object is written to Class <B>Table</B> under the given name.
	   You need write access for this function to work.</P>

       <P>You can use one of three ways to specify which table-definitions to load.</P>

       <P><B>[-f] <I>filename</I></B> : load the definitions from a file.
           Such files would typically be created by the function "Export defs"
           in Table-Maker. The -f is optional. The <I>filename</I> will be
	   treated relative to the current working directory.
	   Command line parameters (see below) can be specified with this option.</P>

       <P><B>-n <I>objname</I></B> : read the definitions from an existing object
           in the database. The object with the name <I>objname</I> has to exist
           in class <B>Table</B>. This is convienient way to access pre-defined
	   definitions. 
	   Command line parameters (see below) can be specified with this option.</P>

       <P><B>= <I>def_command<CODE>\n</CODE>def_command<CODE>\n</CODE>def_command</I></B> :
           a mode of loading definitions that is probably reserved for automatic scripts etc.
           The entire edefinition can be specified literally on the command line.
           The <I>def_commands</I> are separated by the escaped line-feed characters '\n'
           The commands would be each line from the result of showing the Table-object
	   in ace-format (see show -a). As the rest of line is taken as definitions
	   no command line parameters can be substituted.</P>


        <P>The rest of the line is taken as command line parameters. Such parameters are used
	to substitue all %1, %2 %3 etc.. substitution directions in the text of the definitions.
	If a parameter should contain multiple words is has to be quoted (i.e. object names containing spaces).
	If the definitions contain parameters %1 and %2 the following command line can be issued :</P>

	<P><CODE>acedb>  table-maker wquery/example.def "aa c" dddd</CODE></P>

        <P>which will replace the directive %1 with 'aa c' and %2 with 'dddd'. Without
	the quotes, dddd would have been treated as a third parameter.</P>

	<P>The definitions are then parsed and executed, and the resulting table
	is output in the specified format. At the end of the table a comment
	states how many lines the table contains. The objects in the first column
	become the new active keyset, so another column will state how many
	different object are contained in column 1, before the "acedb&gt;" prompt returns
