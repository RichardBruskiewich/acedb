<H1> The Homology List </H1>

<P>
The Homology List gives the names of the homologous loci plotted within a single cell of the Oxford Grid. The left column gives the loci on the relevant Map in the first species (the x-axis of the grid) and the right column gives their homologues in the second species (the y-axis of the grid). The total number of homologues within the particular cell is given at the top of the Homology List window. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the loci in the list may be double-clicked. When this occurs, the graphical display of the Map on which the clicked locus is located is brought up, with that locus highlighted.
</P>

<P>Button options available within the Homology List are :<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Export...        - a menu enabling the user to export all loci in the list to a file, or alternatively just the loci from one Map or the other

<P>Menu options available within the Homology List are :<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Quit             - destroys the Homology List window
<LI>Help             - displays this help information
<LI>Show as Text     - brings up a text window showing information on the currently selected locus (this is sometimes more useful than double clicking on the locus, which goes directly to the graphical display of the Map on which the locus is located)
<LI>Print            - brings up the Print/Mail Selection tool
<LI>Preserve         - preserves the current Homology List
