<h2>Genetic-map</h2>

This display represent the genetic map.  You can pick most things.<p>

The contigs are displayed past their last gene -- in many
cases they extend much further, but we don't really know how far in
genetic units so take our estimate with caution.<p>

If you double click on the contig it interpolates to the physical map
using the nearest two genes for which there is genetic map data.
Sometimes if the relative order is wrong this can be confusing.  All
this will improve in the future.<p>

<h3>Menu items:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quit</strong>: quits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Print</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer.

<li><strong>Preserve</strong>: ensure that the next gmap will be
displayed in a different window, otherwise the present one will be
reused.

<li><strong>Recalculate</strong>: recomputes the display from the map
data.  Otherwise, the same display is shown again and again. We could
make the recalculation automatic after any update of the clone tress
but it would slow the program if you alter some data which do not
actually influence the drawing.

<li><strong>Highlight Selected Objects/Show Selected Objects/Show All
Objects</strong>: Highlight or restrict to only those objects
belonging to the map and the selected keyset (normally the list in the
Main Selection Window, or one made by the Query facility).  All
reverts to the complete unhighlighted map, and removes any
highlighting from the GMap Data button option.

<li><strong>Load/Save Private Map</strong>: After editing a map you
can save and retrieve it later.  The saved map does not appear in the
standard chromosome list.

</ul>

<h3>Buttons</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Whole Chromosome, Zoom In/Out</strong>: affect the amount
of the map being displayed. They are equivalent to the continuous
centering and zooming that you get by picking with the middle button
in the left column of the map and dragging up-down to recenter,
left-right to zoom.

<li><strong>GMap Data</strong>: Shows CGC map data in graphical form.
You can click on the 2point and 3point data entries to see the actual
data.

<li><strong>Highlight/Some/All</strong>: Equivalent of the menu
entries to highlight or show selected or all objects.

<li><strong>Drag Gene</strong>: Pick a gene or a def-dup, press this
button, then drag the gene with the mid mouse button. Useful to edit
the map. You can then save your private version.

</ul>

<h3>Colour Code</h3>

When using the "GMap Data" button, colours represent
the following information:<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Red</strong>: The active object.

<li><strong>Yellow</strong>: Contact to the physical map.  Yellow
genes are cloned.  The little yellow boxes are direct hooks to these
clones.  The long yellow bar is the contig. Picking it moves you to
the corresponding place in the contig.

<li><strong>Grey</strong>: Background to the name of the colored
rearrangement.

<li><strong>Green</strong>: Those genes covered by the red
rearrangement.  Those rearrangements covering a red gene.  The gene
mapped 2_points relative to the red gene.

<li><strong>Blue</strong>: Those genes not covered by the red
rearrangement.  Those rearrangements not covering a red gene.  The
gene mapped 3_points relative to the red gene.

<li><strong>Magenta </strong>: Objects explicitly highlighted with the
Highlight option.

</ul>

The <strong>All</strong> button removes green, blue and magenta
colours.<p>

<h3>Zoom and Recentre</h3>

The <strong>ZOOM</strong> buttons act on the whole map around the
center represented by the little green box.<p>

You can recenter the display by pressing with the centre mouse
button and dragging, or by picking with the left mouse button and
dragging either:<p>

<ul>
<li>the small  black box sitting on the scale.
<li>or the long green box at the left of the picture.
</ul>
