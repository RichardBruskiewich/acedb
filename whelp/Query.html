<h2>Query Commands</h2>

The syntax of the acedb query language is a little complex but quite
powerful. It is explained in the <A
HREF="Query_syntax.html">Query_syntax</a> help section and in the
latex document doc/query_syntax. The query interface allows you to
write command files with parameters. You can load and execute these as
external programs (in $ACEDB/wquery/xxx.qry). Thus you can prepare in
advance sets of useful commands for selecting data.<p>

An easier, but less powerful, interface is provided by the <A
HREF="Query_Builder.html">Query_Builder</a> and <A
HREF="Query_By_Example.html">Query_by_example</a> which can be accessed
from the main acedb menu. The related <A
HREF="Table_Maker.html">Table_Maker</a> allows the contruction of
relational tables.<p>

<h3>Other details</h3>

<strong>Direct Query Commands</strong> allows the FULL query syntax.
See help on <A HREF="Query_syntax.html">Query_syntax</a> for more
details. Edit the text box the same as any User Entry Boxes (pick with
mouse, use keyboard).  Execute a query command by clicking (again) on
the left mouse button or hitting the RETURN key.<p>

If you edit the last command line a new, blank box is created for the
next input query command.<p>
	
<strong>Scope</strong>: If the query starts as <strong>FIND
my_class</strong>, the whole class my_class is searched; otherwise the
query commands act on the active Keyset (selection list).  To select
another KeySet, pick it once (the pink label "Selected KeySet" will
appear in the KeySet window). See <A HREF="KeySet.html">help on
KeySets</a> for more information.<p>
