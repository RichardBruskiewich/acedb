<h2>MesgList Window</h2>

<P>This window displays a rolling list of AceDB informational and error
messages that would normally be displayed in individual "popup" dialog windows
which require the user to click on an "OK" button to get rid of the window.
This window provides a good alternative for situations where a large number
of messages get displayed (e.g. when there are DNA mismatches) and clicking "OK"
would get <b>very</b> annoying.

<P>You can choose between having errors
reported in the usual "popup" dialogs or instead having this single "message list" window
which will display a rolling list of messages as
they are generated. The messages do not need to be replied to, they are displayed
in the window and when a new message arrives it is displayed in red and
the window is raised above other acedb windows to alert you to the new message.
Each message is preceded with a time stamp so that, if a large number of identical
messages are being generated, it's possible to see that new messages are
being generated.

<P>(<b>Note</b> that Exit or Crash messages are still displayed in an individual
"popup" dialog window.)

<P>The "message list" is configured from the "Admin.." menu from the main window.
Select "Preferences", and then from the "Preferences Editor" window you can set:

<dl>
  <dt><b><code>USE_MSG_LIST</code></b>
  <dd>Set this "on" to use the message list window instead of popups, or "off"
      to go back to popups.
  <dt><b><code>MAX_MSG_LIST_LENGTH</code></b>
  <dd>You can control the number of messages that the window will display
      so that if you want to record all messages you could set this to
      some very large figure, perhaps several hundred. (The maximum possible is
      2,000.)
</dl>

<P><b>N.B.</b> You should note that for any preferences where you have to
type a value, you <b>must</b> press the <b><code>return</code></b> key
before you click the "Apply" or "Save" buttons. If you don't do this, the
value you have entered will be ignored.

<P>Once you have selected <b><code>USE_MSG_LIST</code></b> and clicked
the "Apply" or "Save" buttons, a new window with the title
"AceDB Normal/Error Messages" will appear. The window has scroll bars
so that you can adjust it to the size you want and also scroll through
messages.

<P>If there are no messages then the window will show

<P>"&lt; No messages currently &gt;"

<P>As messages arrive they are displayed with the newest at the bottom displayed in
red, older messages are scrolled off the top once the list has reached
<b><code>MAX_MSG_LIST_LENGTH</code></b> in size. Each message is shown with
a time stamp so that you can see when it arrived. You will see something
like this:

<pre>
  <font color="black">2001-06-14_16:35:30:  Sorry, no help subject registered for this window !
  2001-06-14_16:35:31:  Sorry Roger, none of your DNA matches !
  2001-06-14_16:35:32:  Your Source_Exons are off the end of your sequence !
  <font color="red">2001-06-14_16:35:33:  Please use AceDB 4_9 from now on !</font>

</pre>

<P>You can do the following from the message list window menu:
<dl>
  <dt><b>"Quit"</b>
  <dd>Completely remove the message list window, but note that the next
      time AceDB needs to display an informational/error message
      the window will be recreated unless you use the "Preferences Editor"
      to return to "popup" messages.
  <dt><b>"Reset"</b>
  <dd>Will remove all currently displayed messages from the window.
  <dt><b>"Refresh"</b>
  <dd>Simply redraws the window exactly as-is.
  <dt><b>"Save"</b>
  <dd>Save the contents of the window to a file of your choice.
  <dt><b>"Print"</b>
  <dd>Send the contents of the window to a printer, a file or mail to a user.
  <dt><b>"Help"</b>
  <dd>Display this file. 
</dl>

<P>You can return to having individual popups at any time by
setting <b><code>USE_MSG_LIST</code></b> "off" from the "Preferences Editor"
window.
