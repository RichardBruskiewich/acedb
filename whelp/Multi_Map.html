<h2>Multi_Map</h2>

This utility is invoked by the Map button of the <A
HREF="Table_Maker_Data.html">data window</a> for the <A
HREF="Table_Maker.html">TableMaker</a>.<p>

The interface is modelled on the genetic map display.  Each numerical
column of the table corresponds to a map. Each entry is shown as a
yellow square which you may pick. Squares in neighbouring columns
corresponding to a single line of the table are linked together, if
ending on the name of the object in column 1 of the definition of the
table. Note that by switching the columns in the table, you switch the
maps but you cannot change the name shown.  This is because only the
name in column 1 is garanteed to be unique.<p>

When you pick a name or a square, the corresponding line in the Table
is highlighted. Furthermore, you display the first object upwards from
where the number was gotten from. Concretely, in a multimap, you move
to that map you are looking at, centered on the locus, which I hope is
what you want.<p>

<h3>Menu items:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quit</strong>: quits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Print</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer.

<li><strong>Zoom all/Zoom active</strong>: The Whole, zoom-in,
zoom-out button and the usual mid-mouse zoom and drag (x-y mouse
motion started on left edge of the graph) apply either all the columns
or to the active one only.

</ul>

With these functions it is easy to realign a given region of the
mutimap.<p>

The active map is indicated because its name shows in a green
background. Note that the left green box always shows the extent of
the display of the active map.<p>

<strong>Flip</strong> causes a vertical flip of the active map. This
is useful if the coordinates in that map run in the opposite direction
with respect to another one.<p>

<strong>Switch</strong> moves the active map one column to the
right. This can be useful because only the links between direct
neighbours is materialised.<p>
