<h2>ACEDB Main Window</h2>

This help contains information on how to use the ACEDB Main
Window.<P>

<h2>To exit the program, choose <strong>Quit</strong> from the menu in
the Main Window.</h2>

The Main Window presents a list of Classes, which are the categories 
around which information is organized in the database. 
For example, a class called "Locus" could
be designed to store information about genetic markers.  Each class
consists of a list of members called "objects". The objects named ABC1
and xyz-1 might be members of the Locus class.<p>

By default all visible classes (as specified in 
<A HREF="Class_Configuration.html">wspec/options.wrm</A>) are
displayed in the class chooser. The way classes are presented is
configurable on the <A HREF="Layout.html">layout editor</A> 
by clicking the button "Set Selection"<P>

The Main Window lets you find objects in the database in several
ways:<p>

<strong>1. You can pick a visible Class</strong> by clicking with the left
mouse button.  Clicking again will give a list of the names of all
objects in that class in the <A HREF="KeySet.html">Main KeySet</a>,
also called a Selection List. You can restrict this list by typing a
template in the yellow Search box.  When you press the RETURN key you
obtain all names matching the text in the yellow box. Name recognition
usually is not case sensitive, except if this option was explicitly
requested by the database curator. Do not be too fancy. Named are
recognized as-is, backslashes quotes and punctuation will be assumed to
belong to the name. However ? and * are used as wildcards:

<ul>

<li>* in the template will match anything; e.g. "S*" will match all
names beginning with 'S', "*S*" will match all names containing an
'S', "*a*b" all names containing an 'A' and ending with a 'B'.

<li>? in the template will match any single character, e.g. "???"
will match all names that are exactly three characters long.

</ul>

To actually display an object you must pick its name twice in
the Main KeySet. A new window will open containing more information
about the object. The new window might contain <A
HREF="Tree.html">text</a> or be a special display, like a <A
HREF="Genetic-map.html">genetic map</a>.<p>

<strong>2. You can search the database</strong> by typing a text
string in the Text Search box (first click on it with the left button
to make it yellow).  This will find all the objects in the database
which contain the search text.  More precisely, we find all objects
whose name contains the search string, all objects that refer to this
object, and all objects containing searchable Text (or other X class
data) containing the search string.<p>

<strong>3. You can pick any other class Class</strong> by filing the
search box and then clicking on the black triangle following the
words in Class: with the left or the right mouse button.

In addition the Main Window menu allows access to other
applications and functions of ACEDB, many of which have
their own help:<p>
