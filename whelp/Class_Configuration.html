<h2>Configuring Classes with options.wrm</h2>

The special configuration file <B>wspec/options.wrm</B> is read
in conjunction with the database models when the acedb application 
starts up.<BR>
It holds the class definitions necessary to the applications.
The kernel classes are defined in the program code.<BR>
Most options can be changed freely to configure the behaviour
of certain aspects of the program.<BR>

<H3>File format</H3>

All lines starting with _V&lt;class&gt; are parsed, where &lt;class&gt;
is a valid class name from the database models or the name of
a kernel class, if it is wise to change its configuration.<BR>

This token is followed by a set of parameters which is written
like a Unix style command line, i.e. each option starts with a dash '-'
followed by the option name. Option names can be abbreviated down
to the shortest possible length where no ambiguity is possible.

<H3>Class options</H3>

<DL>
  <DT>-Visible</DT>
  <DD>This class will automatically appear in the class chooser of
      the acedb main window.<P>
      This will only affect the default class layout when the
      program first starts. The final layout of the classes
      in the main window can be configured in the 
      <A HREF="Layout.html">Layout editor</A> or in the configuration
      file wspec/layout.wrm<P>
  </DD>

  <DT>-Hidden</DT>
  <DD>This class is not shown automatically in the main window
      class chooser, but will be listed in the class-menu in the
      button 'Other class...' in the main window.<P>
  </DD>

  <DT>-Array</DT>
  <DD>The class is of type 'A' (a class containing fixed sized
      elements in the style of arrays or tuples.)
      An example is the built-in DNA class, which contains a sequence
      of special characters A, C, T, G.<BR>
      The user will not typically use this option.<P>
  </DD>


  <DT>-Btree</DT>
  <DD>The class is of type 'B', which are the user-defined classes
      in models.wrm, which have a tree-like structure.<BR>
      As this is the default for classes that appear in models.wrm,
      The user will not typically use this option.<P>
  </DD>


  <DT>-Display &lt;displaytype&gt;</DT>
  <DD>An important option to configure the behaviour of the graphical
      acedb applications. All 'B' class objects are usually shown
      in the textual <A HREF="Tree.html">Tree</A> display, when the
      object is fecthed by a double click in a graphical display.
      However special displays like the  Map displays have been written 
      for certain classes to present the object's information 
      graphically.<BR>
      This option is used to configure, which display will be used by
      default. There are a number of displays, but to give an example,
      the type GMAP is used for the Map class, or the type FMAP for the
      Sequence class. The option 'Show as Text' which is available
      in the <A HREF="KeySet.html">KeySet window</A> and also in map
      displays will force the display in the default TREE display
      if necessary.<P>
  </DD>

  <DT>-Title &lt;Tag&gt;</DT>
  <DD>If present in some object of that class, the text following it
      will be used preferentially when referring to that object.<P>
  </DD>

  <DT>-Symbol &lt;Tag&gt;</DT>
  <DD>If present in some object of that class, the text
      or key following it will be used preferentially
      when referring to that object in Maps.<P>
  </DD>


  <DT>-Rename &lt;otherName&gt;</DT>
  <DD>Other name will show in lists, old and new
      name will be recognized in ace files and queries, old
      is used in the code. In case some newName
      matches some old name, the new name takes precedence.<P>
  </DD>

  <DT>-CaseSensitive</DT>
  <DD>The names in this class will be case sensitive
      (case-insensitivity is the default).
      This applies to all queries. A case-sensitive class
      can have an object called 'aa' and another object 'AA'.
      By default a class is not case-sensitive, so in that class
      any mention of 'aa' will refer to the same object as 'AA'.
      <BR>
      Never undo this option once it has been used, as it may corrupt
      the integrity of the database. Imagine you have a case-sensitive
      class with two object called 'aa' and 'AA'. If this class was
      now made ce-insensitive, you would have to fuse the two objects
      'aa' and 'AA' into one object, because in the case-insensitive
      class noth names would refer to the same object.
      This can be achieved by hand, if the whole class in dumped,
      then you unset this option and destroy the class in the database
      before reading in the dump file. The parser would then fuse the
      objects as necessary but with unforseen consequences.<P>
  </DD>

  <DT>-Known</DT>
  <DD>Prevents indirect creation of new object in ace files
      You can't enter a new object in this class directly
      but not by quoting it in another object.<P>
  </DD>

</DL>

The default options for each user-defined classes are
<CODE>-Btree -Hidden -Display TREE</CODE>.<P>

Every 'A' class has a special function the program that defined how the 
array elements are to be read from an ace-file and how they are dunped out to an ace-file. These classes are therefor built into the program code
and probably shouldn't be re-configured.<P>
