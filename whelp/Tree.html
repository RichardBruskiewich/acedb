<h2>Tree Display</h2>

<p> All objects whose structure is defined in the wspec/models.wrm file can be displayed in the
Tree Display window. This includes objects that are usually viewed in special displays (e.g., loci
on maps and maps themselves). The term "tree" refers to the fact that the data is arranged in a
branching, hierarchical structure that functions as an outline, possibly with many levels of
indentation.


<h3>Buttons</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quit</strong>: destroys this window.

<li><strong>Tables... </strong>: this button is only present if a <A
HREF="Table_Maker.html">TableMaker</a> command file has been
registered with the class of the current object in the 
file <A HREF="TreeTableMenu.html">wspec/table.menu.wrm</A>. 
If present, the button contains a sub-menu with
the list of these tables which are selected with the right mouse
button.  If you choose a table, the TableMaker is launched and the
table displayed.

<li><strong>Attach</strong>: Allows you to graft information from a
related object directly into the window. First pick an item by
clicking on it once. The item must be a link to another object or a
tag adjacent to the left of such a link. The attach button brings up a
BLOCKING tag chooser window which lets you select what part of the
related object to graft. You can graft any branch or sub-branch by
double-clicking on a node in the tag chooser. Help for <A
HREF="Attach.html">Attach</a> and for the <A
HREF="Tag-Chooser.html">Tag Chooser</a> are available.

</ul>


<h3>Menu items:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quit</strong>: quits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Print</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer.

<li><strong>Update</strong>: Lets you edit the object if you
have write access.  See help on <A HREF="Update.html">Update</a> for
more information.

<li><strong>Toggle Timestamps</strong>: Displays to the right of each
node the information on who/when last updated that value, this information
corresponds to one of the session object which can be seen from the
admin/session control menu of the main window

<li><strong>Show selected object as text</strong>: Displays the
selection in a text window if possible, rather than graphically as may
happen when you double click a box.

</ul>

<h4>Tab key</h4>

<p>The <code>Tab</code> key allows you to quickly cursor through all visible tags/data on
the screen, it skips over any collapsed branches (press Return to step into
those). <code>Alt - Tab</code> allows you to do this in the other direction.

<ul>
  <li><b><code>Tab</code></b> to tab forward.
  <li><b><code>Alt - Tab</code></b> to tab backward.
</ul>




<h4>Cursor keys</h4>

<p>The cursor keys <b><code>&lt;, &gt;, &#094; & v</code></b>, allow moving through the visible tags/data
on a strict left, right, up and down basis respectively. They do not jump to the next
branch level but instead wrap round within a branch.

<p><b><code>Alt - &lt;</code></b> will jump back to the very leftmost node of a branch.






<H3>Special action tags</H3>

The model for any class may contain special tags which launch special actions
in the tree display. You can add these tags to any class in the database models.
The fields that the models are expected to define to the right of the tag vary.
A double click on the tag-name in the tree display will launch the special
action.<P>

<DL>
  <DT><B>Pick_me_to_call</B><DT>
  <DD>Calls up an external program. Has two Text fields to the right of the
      tag. The first is the script name, the second one it's arguments.<BR>
      Often present in class Image, to display an externally stored image file
      using the 'display_script'.
  </DD>
  <P>

  <DT><B>Gel</B></DT>
  <DD>Launches the <A HREF="Gel-Patterns.html">Gel Pattern</a> display.
      The field to the right of the tag should contain the
      sub-model #Bands, which is a list of integers containing band 
      lengths or migration distances.
  </DD>
  <P>

  <DT><B>E_mail</B></DT>
  <DD>Opens the configured mailer with the email address as it's argument.
      The address is expected one field to the right of the E_mail
      tag.<BR>
      The script <CODE>$ACEDB/wscripts/acedb_mailer</CODE>
      is invoked by this action, nothing will happen apart from
      a warning on the command line if this script can't be invoked.
  </DD>
