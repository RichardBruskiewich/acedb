<h2>Add/Delete/Rename/Alias Objects</h2>

This window lets you perform various operations on whole objects.
Currently you can add new objects, delete entire objects, edit
and rename objects. Two objects can also be fused into one.
You must have acquired write access for it to work.<p>

For every operation you need to select an object to work on by its class and its name :<P>

First you select a class. Either choose the class from the right button 
menu on the "Class:" button or single click on a class from the choice
between the menu buttons. (Double clicking on the classes does nothing
and it not to be confused with the behavior in the main window)<P>
Now select the object by typing its name in the yellow entry box 
labeled "Name:". For an operation other than 'Create' it makes sense
for the name to be a valid object name in the selected class.<P>

You can easily import an object's class and name using the "Pick object"
function, which lets you `grab` the object from another window.
Activate the object chooser by clicking on the "Pick object" button.
Now go to another <A HREF="KeySet.html">KeySet</A> window or another
<A HREF="Tree.html">Tree</A> window and double click on an object name,
which is written in bold.<P>

All actions are initiated from the right button background menu or
the menu buttons :<P>


<h3>Menu items:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quit</strong>: quits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Create</strong>: creates a new object entry in the
selected class and displays an empty tree window for it so you can 
go into <A HREF="Update.html">update mode</A> and add data if you
want.<P>

<li><strong>Display</strong>: displays the selected object, 
just as if you'd double clicked on it from e.g. another
KeySet window.<P>

<li><strong>Edit</strong>: The selected object is displayed and 
opened in the usual <A HREF="Update.html">update mode</A> of the
<A HREF="Tree.html">Tree display</A>.<P>

<li><strong>Alias/Fuse</strong>: You will then be prompted for an 
alias name for the selected object. By creating an alias both the 
old and new name will be recognized, but the new name you enter
will be the one the database writes out (canonical name).  If it is
the name of an existing object then the two will be fused.<P>

<li><strong>Rename/Fuse</strong>: you first must pick a class and
supply an object name. You will then be prompted for a new name.
Rename is a hard rename function.  Unless you are just
changing case, the old name will no
longer apply to this or any other current object (you can
reuse it for a new object).  If the new name belongs to
an existing object the two objects will be fused. <BR>
If you want both names to apply for the object 
use the 'Alias' function.<P>

<li><strong>Delete</strong>: deletes object with all its data<P>

</ul>
