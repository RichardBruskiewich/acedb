<h2>Acedb sessions and the control window</h2>


<H3>What is session ?</H3>
In Acedb a session can be thought of as a collection of modifications
between "Gain write access" and "Save" actions. 
<P>
When the database starts up, this initial state is session 1. Every
time the user gains write access, a new session (called <B>This_session</B>)
is derived from the previous. 
Sessions are given sequential numbers. All initial additions before first save 
after the database was initialized will be stored in session 2.
Changes to the new objects are newly added ones are stored in Session 3 etc.
<P>
A new session inherits all the data from its predecessor and it will also
store modifications.
<P>
Objects can modified either interactively or by parsing ace-files.
Until the user saves, all modified objects are held in a cache.
When the database saves it copies those modified objects 'flushed'
out of the cache and copied into the main-database.
<P>
Any user starting the database after that "save" will be able to 'see'
the changes. Users who started the same database before that "save"
occurred will not notice the changes and continue looking at the
old data (if they happen to look at an object which was modified).
<P>

<H3>Session garbage collection</H3>

When a new process starts up the database, it build up an image
of where objects are stored in the database. This enables it to
quickly find an object on disk and display it on the screen.
<P>
When objects are added or modified in a new session they are stored
in a different place in the database. This way an process that has started
before the save can still find the older objects in their original place,
and the user can continue browsing the database.
<P>
There is however an overhead to this. If every old version of an object was
kept in the database it would quickly grow out of proportion.
This is why the database flushes older data out of the database in regular intervals
to reclaim their disk space. That is a process known as garbage collection.
<P>
All changes to the database are always nicely bundled into a session. It is therefor 
convenient to destroy older sessions, every time a new one is saved.
For reasons of data security a certain number of older sessions is kept alive.
This number is usually 2 or 3 and it can be configured for a given database
by adding this line to the file <CODE>wspec/database.wrm</CODE>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE 2</BLOCKQUOTE>

This configuration feature is available since version 4.7b, earlier versions
will most likely use the number 2 by default. It may be configured to be bigger
than that, but the smallest number allowed is 2.
<P>

<H3>Session read-locks</H3>

We have discussed the notion of processes still being able to browse
objects in their original place in the database, although another process
has updated the database which has moved some objects to a new location.
If an updating process performs a lot of saves, it may 'garbage collect'
older sessions. This would crash a process that was still looking at objects from
older sessions, if their sessions were deleted virtually under their feet
by another updating process.
<P>
A protection mechanism is available since version 4.7b to protect such session
from deletion if another program is still looking at it. This mechanism is called a
"read-lock". It tells the database if there are any programs still browsing through
data from older sessions before destroying them.
<P>
When the database quits normally its read-lock is removed and its sessions
must no longer be kept alive. If however, the database exited in an unexpected way
(like a computer failure or a program crash) it's read-lock may remain in the database.
For this reason, every read-lock which is older than a certain time-span is ignored
by an updating program which checks which old sessions can be destroyed.
In Acedb version 4.7b this 'grace_period' is fixed to 8 hours, but it may become
configurable in future releases.
<P>

$Log: Session_control.html,v $
Revision 1.5  1999-04-28 13:13:23  fw
added BODY tag with white BGCOLOR

Revision 1.4  1999/03/22 14:45:41  fw
corrected syntax of comment at the top

Revision 1.3  1999/01/15 18:13:22  fw
first version of this file with actual content,
it explains acedb sessions, garbage collection of old sessions
and readlocks.
It will need work, as novice users may not understand what I'm talking about.
