<H1> Acedb user guide: giface </H1>

From the user's point of view, giface is a version of tace with
extensions to generate gif and map files corresponding for acedb
displays.
<P>
(From the programmer's point of view, it is more like xace, but with gif-images
as its graphics output mode instead of interactive X11-windows.)<P>

A lot of improvements have been made to the general user-friendliness
of giface since version 4.8. Since this version is still in development
and may not be officially released. Comments are included about the restrictions
of giface version 4.7 and earlier.<P>

You run giface just like tace, with the database directory as a
command line argument, or set as the ACEDB environment variable.
There is a new single new command added to the standard tace menu,
"gif".  This opens up a separate menu, with prompt "acedb-gif> ".  In
this menu you can issue the following commands:<P>
(command options inside [brackets] are optional, the vertical bar '|' indicates a choice of possible options, words in <I>italics</I> are values specified by the user.)

<H2>Commands</H2>


<DL>
<DT><B>dimensions [-D <I>displaytype</I>] <I>x y</I></B></DT>
  <DD>This sets the dimensions in pixels of the image that subsequent
      command will create. The default sizes for all or only a
      specified displaytype will be reset.
      <BR>
      Note on version 4.7 and earlier : no -D option available - only the sizes for
      displays of type GMAP, FMAP and PMAP will be affected. For multiple
      dimension changes to take effect you had to quit and re-enter the gif sub-menu.
  </DD>

<DT><B>display [-D <I>displaytype</I>] [-view <I>view</I>] [<I>class key</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Graphic display of the current (or the specified object). An object
      is defined by its class and its key (the object's name).<BR>
      This is the same action that xace would perform when 
      double-clicking on the object when its listed in the 
      <A HREF=KeySet.html>KeySet window</A>.<BR>
      The default display mode is the standard <A HREF=Tree.html>Tree
      Display</A> (e.g. for Author objects) or a graphical map display 
      (e.g. for sequence objects). The -D option can be used to
      change the default display type. The argument <I>displaytype</I>
      can be one of display types listed in 
      <CODE><A HREF="Class_Configuration.html">wspec/options.wrm</A></CODE>,
      where the default type for each class is defined. 
      Typically you would use
      <CODE>-D TREE</CODE> to force the textual display or
      <CODE>-D GMAP</CODE> for Map objects, <CODE>-D FMAP</CODE>
      for Sequence objects or <CODE>-D PMAP</CODE> for Clone objects.<BR>
      The -view options works for map displays of type GMAP and allows
      the user to specify the view object to be used to configure the
      GMAP display. The argument <I>view</I> is a valid name of a View
      object, which contain column definitions.
   </DD>
   <P>


<DT><B>gifdump <I>filename</I></B></DT>
  <DD>Saves the active graph as a gif-image. The extension ".gif"
      is added if <I>filename</I>, doesn't already have that suffix.
      Other information about clickable objects on the graph
      is written to <I>filename</I>.boxes (if filename has no
      ".gif" suffix) or <I>basename</I>.boxes (where basename
      is the <I>filename</I> argument with the ".gif" suffix).
      The format of the .boxes file is explained below.<BR>
      This command is typically used after the <B>display</B> or 
      <B>map</B> command.<BR>
      If <I>filename</I> is not an absolute pathname (starting with '/')
      the file will be created in current working directory.
      <BR>
      Note on version 4.7 and earlier : You should always specify an 
      absolute pathname, and the extensions .gif and .boxes are always 
      added to the filename.
  <DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>psdump <I>filename</I></B></DT>
  <DD>Saves the active graph as postscript. The extension ".ps" 
      is added if <I>filename</I>, doesn't already have that suffix.
      This command is typically used after the <B>display</B> or 
      <B>map</B> command.<BR>
      If <I>filename</I> is not an absolute pathname (starting with '/')
      the file will be created in current working directory.
      <BR>
      Note on version 4.7 and earlier : You should always specify an 
      absolute pathname, and the extensions .ps is not added and should 
      be provided in the <I>filename</I> argument by hand.
  <DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>map <I>map</I> [-view <I>view</I>] [-coords <I>x1</I> <I>x2</I>] [-hideheader] [-whole]</B></DT>
  <DD>Set up a map display of the object <I>map</I>. The optional -view
      options has the function as for the <CODE>display</CODE> command.
      To zoom to a specific section of the map use the -coords option
      with the coordinate arguments <I>x1</I> and <I>x2</I> or the
      -whole option to show the entire map in one image.<BR>
      If the image is used for a Web display, it may be useful
      to use <CODE>-hideheader</CODE> to blank out the buttons in the top
      row that you would usually see in this display in xace.<BR>
      This command doesn't create an image file straight away, use
      the command <B>gifdump</B> to write out the result image.
   </DD>
   <P>

<DT><B>pmap [-clone <I>name</I>] | [-contig <I>name</I> <I>coord</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Create a physical map display for clones and contigs.
      Use the command <B>gifdump</B> or <B>psdump</B> to write 
      out the result image.
  </DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>seqget [<I>sequence</I> [-coords <I>x1 x2</I>]]</B></DT>
  <DD>Sets active sequence for further seq- operations.
      The following seq- commands are issued in the same command line, e.g.<BR>
      <CODE>seqget bK714B7 ; seqactions -hide_header ; seqdisplay -visible_coords 10000 40000</CODE>
          
  </DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>seqactions  [-dna] [-gf_features] [-hide_header] [-rev_comp]</B></DT>
  <DD>Change parameters on the active sequence display.</DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>seqcolumns {-on <I>name</I>} {-off <I>name</I>} [-list]</B></DT>
  <DD>Changes column settings on active sequence display.
      Multiple <CODE>-on ...</CODE> or <CODE>-off ...</CODE>
      options can be specified. The column names are not case-sensitive,
      and names containing spaces have to be &quot;quoted&quot;.<BR>
      The names of available columns can be listed with the <CODE>-list</CODE>
      option. The columns are listed left to right with a '+' or '-'
      sign denoting whether they're switched on or off.
      <BR>
      Note on version 4.7 and earlier : column names are case-sensitive
      and the -list option isn't available.
  </DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>seqdisplay [-visible_coords <I>v1 v2</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Creates the actual display for the active sequence. 
      This is typically the last command in a sequence of commands starting
      with <B>seqget</B>. The image of the active graph can be written 
      out using the gifdump or psdump function (see there).
  </DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>seqfeatures [-file <I>fname</I>] [-version 1|2] [-list] [-source <I>source(s)</I>] [-feature <I>feature(s)</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Writes out sequence features from the current sequence.
     The arguments for <CODE>-source</CODE> and 
     <CODE>-feature</CODE> are '|' separated lists.
     It operates over the region specified by the -coords in the previous
     seqget command.
  </DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>seqdna [-file <I>fname</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Writes out the DNA sequence of the current sequence.
     It operates over the region specified by the -coords in the previous
     seqget command.
  </DD>
  <P>      

<DT><B>pepget <I>protein | peptide</I> [-coords <I>x1 x2</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Sets current protein for further pep- operations on the same line.</DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>pepseq [-file <I>fname</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Exports current peptide sequence.</DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>pepalign [-file <I>fname</I>]</B></DT>
  <DD>Exports homols of current peptide sequence.</DD>
  <P>

<DT><B>makemaps -gmap | -pmap | -cmap | -alpha | -all | -seqmap <I>file</I> | -seqclonemap <I>file</I></B></DT>
  <DD>makes cached maps and sorted class keysets</DD>

<DT><B>quit</B></DT>
  <DD>This returns to the standard tace menu.</DD>
</DL>

You can issue any series of commands, creating many
gifs from one session of giface.

<H2>.boxes file format</H2>

This file can be used in creating WWW displays, where the gif-image
is used as a clickable map. The hot-spots on the image can be extracted
from the .boxes file.<P>
The file is a set of lines :</P>

<PRE>
boxnum x1 y1 x2 y2 <I>class</I>:<I>name</I> <I>extra_text</I>
</PRE>

<P>The boxnum is probably irrelevant to external people.  x1,y1,x2,y2 are
the bounding box coordinates.  The first 'class:name' specifies the
object in the box.  The extra text is variable information that can be
added by the specific display.  Often it contains information that can
be used for mouseover type behavior.  There may be no extra text.</P>

<H2>Example</H2>

Here is a sample session:<P>

<PRE>
Unix-prompt: giface ~wormpub/acedb/ace4/cam
acedb&gt; gif
acedb-gif&gt; dim 600 480
acedb-gif&gt; map Sequence-III -view MAP-sequence
acedb-gif&gt; gifdump /tmp/seqIII
...
acedb-gif&gt; quit
// 0 Active Objects 
acedb&gt; quit

// A bientot 

Unix-prompt: 
</PRE>
