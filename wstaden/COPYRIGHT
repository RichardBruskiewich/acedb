The modifications i have done are:

1) i wrote my own makefile as a section inside the acedb makefile
2) i modified a few file names to prevent conflicts with acedb file names
3) i added a few () to please the compiler 
4) i modified a little os.h (under #ifdef ACEDB) to simplify portability

All these modifications are trivialities which do not alter the original code
The modules are compiled by the acedb makefile in a static library: libstaden
which is then used in acedb applications like acembly by linking -lstaden

=====================================================================

In addition, in march 2000, i added CTF support to the preexisting
support of ABI SCF ALF and PLAIN formats

CTF is a new more compact format that i constructed

so i added a CTF case to a the Staden switches in about 8 files
(this is done the local conventions)
and i added the code
  scf2ctf.c ctf.scf.c  : simple main() of a few lines
  ctfCompress.c : the real work
  makefile, makefile.staden: to compile a la acedb in multi platforms

As of today, ctfCompress.c needs acedb libfree.a because it uses acedb
arrays, but this is historic and this dependancy could be removed AND
the scf->ctf->scf transform conserves the basecall and traces but is
not exact something should still be fixed in the code


Jean Thierry-Mieg, march 2000

To test the system:

setenv ACEDB_MACHINE LINUX_4
make libfree.a
cd wstaden
make all
cd ..
bin.LINUX_4/scf2ctf < foo.scf > foo.ctf
bin.LINUX_4/scf2ctf < foo.ctf > foo.ctf.scf
