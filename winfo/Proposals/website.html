<TITLE>Reorganisation of the Acedb web site</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>General Appearance</H1>

<H3>The acedb logo</H3>

<P>Current logo is OK, but only just about, its too wishy/washy in colour and doesn't really
grab you. We need a new, punchier one. Roger of the Web Team should be able to knock us
one up.

<H3>Navigation buttons</H3>

<P>We need a standard set of navigation buttons on each page to allow the user to back track,
go to the home page and perhaps to the introductory page of the section they are currently in.

<H3>Page layout</H3>

<p>We should make use of the web team to design our own top/tailing of our pages to
give a standardised appearance, they know how to do all this stuff.

<H3>Acedb papers/articles</H3>

<p>Should have a standard template for preparing these, just like the Apache docs.
Should have a standard header which includes the logo image, etc. etc.



<H1>Site layout</H1>

<P>Needs completely reworking, its tailored towards developers far too much.

<P>We should have some page hit monitoring to see where people go most often.

<P>We need to add at least the following:
<ul>
  <li> Links to our newsgroup
  <li> link to our CVS, especially when we have the pucker server set up.
  <li> A "New" section that highlights the latest changes.
  <li> Make sure we link to the latest AcePerl stuff.
  <li> point to the bionet search stuff.
  <li> a who's who page or at least pointers to other major sites using acecb.
</ul>



<H1>Docs section</H1>

<p>The current docs should be hived off into an "old docs" section and we should
start again and add only relevant documentation.

<p>We need broad headline groups such as:
<ul>
  <li> developer
  <li> users
  <li> tutorial
  <li> history/papers
</ul>



<H1>A "users" section</H1>

<P>This should include items such as:

<ul>
  <li> pointers to acedb tools
  <li> pointers to Sylvias tutorial notes.
</ul>



<H1>A new "Showcase" section</H1>

<P>There are lots of really good examples of acedb usage around the world. We need
to point to these from our web page. These should include yeast, grain and
Lincolns DAS project.

<P>On this page we should include:
<ul>
  <li>small downloadable sample databases/models files.
  <li> A new and better FAQ.
  <li> A "How to" section.
  <li> If possible, pointers to Lincolns perl journal articles.
  <li> Any other recent publications on acedb.
</ul>



<H1>Downloads page</H1>

<P>We desperately need a new and better downloads section, we should have proper
pages, not just the directory listing of the ftp site. The pages should be generated
by the same script that copies across the latest binaries from the CVS system.

<P>This page should include models files for other databases, e.g. human, worm etc.

<P>There should also be html format install/maintenance files to supercede the README's,
there simply isn't enough info.

<P>we should also include some of the acedb tools separately to highlight their existence.

<P>Sylvias tutorials are another good candidate for downloads.



<H1>The new FAQ</H1>

<P>The acedb FAQ is woeful, truly woeful. It needs completely revamping. As a start we
could scan the newsgroup and pick up all the hints/tips from there.



<H1>Search index for site</H1>

<P>We need to set up our own "Search" entry box which should be shown on all the main
navigation pages of the site. The search should be of an Alta-Vista index of our web site
and the Acedb Docs web site in the States. This is really important.

<P>As part of this, we should make sure our main pages have "meta-tags" defined that mean
that our pages will come out first in other peoples searches on the word "acedb".
