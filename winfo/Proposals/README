The directory holds descriptions of possible work on parts of acedb that while
desireable cannot currently take place for various reasons. It is a
placeholder or memory aid so that we don't have to keep rediscovering things
that have gone wrong and design shortcomings.

Files should have a name that is suggestive. If a file of items already exists
for a part of acedb then please add to it in a sensible way, don't go creating
new files just for the sake of it.
