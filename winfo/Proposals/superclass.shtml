Keith,

OK, this doesn't work at the moment. Simons code to initialise the struct that            
holds the superclass information was flawed (because he tested it on Linux (32            
bit) and not Alphas (64 bit). In fact his code would stop you initialising an             
acedb database on Alphas with a superclass defined so I've had to fix it !                
                                                                                          
Now I've fixed that but there is another problem in that the superclass now           
appears in the "other class" list in the main window but not in query                     
builder.....sigh....                                                                      
                                                                                          
You would have thought that there might be just one way call to prepare the list          
of classes for the main window or query builder or.... but no, there are several          
routines, all undocumented.                                                               
                                                                                          
I think that main window stuff will work but other bits will not, you'll just             
have to push me when you come to need them.                                               
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
cheers Ed
