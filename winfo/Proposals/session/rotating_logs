This has been shelved because unix systems like linux provide a utility
to automatically rotate logs and all we needed to do was provide a function
that from tace would close and reopen the log. This then allows the utility
to rotate the log files.

Do the rotating logs, do on size and timing (e.g. daily or weekly)
