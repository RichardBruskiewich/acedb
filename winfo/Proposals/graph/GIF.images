This item has been shelved because the patent held by Unisys on GIF images is
about to run out anyway so we just forget all this.

Start the process to swap to PNG instead of gif images:

- consult with acedb developers
- warn acedb users via acedbg, newsgroup, newsletter
- archive the old libgd code
- swop to the new stuff.
