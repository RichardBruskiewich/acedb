Hi folks!  The Curators have three kinds of plans, all of which we're
soliciting volunteer help/expertise for.
- Presentations
- Feature requests
- Documentation projects

The signup lists for these are hanging on the door at the back of the
meeting room.  Please look and sign up!  See me for further description
of any of the items that are incomprehensible.  

The lists as they stand right now are attached below.
