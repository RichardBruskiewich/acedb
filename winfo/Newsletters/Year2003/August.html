<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>

<P>Not much to report this month as most of the acedb developers have been away
on their holidays and are of course now refreshed to hack away at acedb with
renewed vigour.

<a name="Windows"></a><H3>Acedb and MS Windows</H3>

<P>Porting to other platforms is not easy and although the task of porting acedb to MS Windows
is considerably eased by our use of the Cygwin libraries which provide a unix system call
interface on a windows machine, its still not all plain sailing.

<P>Recent problems include:

<ul>
  <li>Modifying code to for temporary directories to match the new Cygwin style
      including adding support for the $TEMP environment variable so user can
      override the default location of the temp directory.
  <li>If the stack size for the acedb process is very low, acedb attempts to raise it but
      this doesn't work on Windows so the code must handle any error and continue.
  <li>Various manglings of include files and macros: "moved definition of COBJMACROS
      and removed #include <objidl.h> to get IMalloc_Free to work properly on Win32" and
      "#include <objidl.h> for new cygwin version and manually #defined IMalloc_Free
      as it's not happening properly" and so on, and so on.
</ul>

<P>For all this the system generally works very well and means that acedb truly runs on Unix,
Mac and MS Windows machines.



<a name="smap"></a><H3>SMap and FMap</H3>

<P>Originally the objects that made the hierachy from which FMap constructed its
view of a sequence had to all belong to the Sequence class. 
The introduction of the SMap code into acedb now allows for hierachies to be
made up of any objects as long as they contain the SMap tags and data.

<P>While this system is very much more flexible and brings many benefits
it has led to some problems in the FMap code. A recent example from the
<i>C. elegans</i> database was a bug which meant that if
a user double clicked on a "Transcript" class
object in the FMap it was not Tree displayed as would normally be expected.
This was caused by an assumption in the code that the object should have been
of the Sequence class.

<P>While this bug has been fixed it is likely that there will be other areas
of FMap that will have to be fixed in the future since much of the code contains
often subtle assumptions that objects will be of the Sequence class. This is work
in progress so if you run into problems with FMap that you suspect are caused by
SMap related changes then please email the
<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb developers</A>.

<a name="smap"></a><H3>Tree display</H3>

<P>Fixed bug in tree display, lookDraw->stackText must be large enough under all
circumstances since it gets passed to graphTextEntry with a buffer
length of 2500.


<a name="blixem"></a><H3>Blixem bug when showing gapped homologies</H3>

<P>(<I>Simon Kelley <A HREF="mailto:srk@sanger.ac.uk">srk@sanger.ac.uk</A>
wins the "Developers award for Persistence under Fire" for sorting this one out.</I>)

<P>Previous versions of acedb did not pass gap information to blixem, the latest monthly
now does this, but.... The process by which acedb passes sequence/clone information to blixem is not straight
forward as account must be taken of orientation (e.g.
was the sequence reverse complemented in fmap ?), whether blixem is being run as part of
xace or as a separate program, what format the gap information should be in and so on and so on.
Sadly this has led to a few bugs. Simon
has manfully tracked these down and fixed them one by one.

<P>You should now find that gapped alignments from fmap are now correctly displayed in blixem.

<a name="aquila"></a><H3>Aquila documentation</H3>

<P>Rob has been adding to and improving documentation for the aquila system,
see <A HREF="http://www.acedb.org/Software/Tools/Aquila/">documentation on the website</A>.
He has improved the sections on how to add and run tests and how to interpret the results.
