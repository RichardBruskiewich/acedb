<P><hr width="62%" align=left>

<P>This month sees better support for Confirmed Introns in FMap, some changes
to EMBL dumping to better support SMap'd classes, some improvements to GFF output
and yes, the usual bug fixes.

<P>If you click on a Confirmed Intron in FMap you will now see which sequence(s)
confirms that intron in the blue report line at the top of FMap.

<a name="EMBL"></a><H3>EMBL dumping</H3>

<P>If you don't use the EMBL dumping options from AceDB then you don't really
need to read this.

<P>Changes to the wormbase database models have enforced some changes to
the EMBL dumping routines in AceDB, this will almost certainly affect you if
you use the AceDB EMBL dump routines.

<P>Only objects that specify an EMBL_dump_method via the EMBL_dump_XXXX tags
will now get dumped, otherwise they will be ignored, this is a tightening up
on previous behaviour.

<P>The code now knows how to handle the new Wormbase
CDS_child, Transcript, Pseudogene and Transposon classes.
The Pseudogene tag has changed to either Coding_pseudogene or RNA_pseudogene.
This has required small but significant changes to the code that handles
CDS vs. RNA and whether something is a pseudogene. If you make use of these tags
you should try out the EMBL dump routines before submitting data to EMBL.


<a name="FMAP_SMAP_GFF"></a><H3>More FMap/SMap/GFF changes</H3>

<P>We have added a new FEATURE_OBJ seg type for more generalised features that result
from smap objects that are not Sequence class objects. These new segs can be handled
in a more generalised way than before.


<a name="GFF"></a><H3>GFF changes</H3>

<P>GFF dumping has been improved so that parent/child related features are dumped
properly, i.e. a CDS with is relevant exons/introns is now labelled correctly.
This includes better support for the GFF_XXX tags in the Method class.

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>


<a name="confirmed_bug"></a><H3>Confirmed Intron bug</H3>

<P>A stupid bug in setting the position of confirmed introns
meant that in certain circumstances they could be off by one on the
forward strand and off by two on the reverse. The basic cause of the bug
was forgetting that database coords are 1-based but FMap segs are 0-based.


<a name="smap_bug"></a><H3>SMap bug</H3>

<P>Fixing a bug in blixem whereby % identity was not correctly calculated for
gapped alignments revealed a bug in sMapLocalMapEx() which caused the nucleic acid coords for a
protein alignment to be truncated.


<a name="blixem_bug"></a><H3>Blixem bug</H3>

<P>Fixed a number of problems with blixem:

<ul>
  <li>Very long sequence names are now abbreviated in the middle so
      annotators can still see beginning/end, current abbrev. is "&gt;&lt;".
  <li>The selected sequence name was being truncated, this is no longer so.
  <li>The % identity routine did not do gapped alignments, it does
      now but not for tblastn or tblastx which will need further work.
</ul>

<a name="ZMap"></a><H3>ZMap</H3>

<P>December has seen much work to get our systems into a state where we can
get on with the detailed implementation of ZMap, we've decided to use more
of the Gnome/GTK software as it is widely ported and most readily available
on Linux.

<P>We've decide for instance to make use the Gnome Canvas for drawing the
sequence etc. as this provides many useful features including complete support
for event handling based on what in the Graph package would be "boxes".


<a name="classModel2Class"></a><H3>classModel2Class() function</H3>

<P>Added classModel2Class() function that given the key that equates to "?&gt;model&lt;"
(e.g. "?Sequence"),
as found in the model for a class, returns the int that represents that class,
returns 0 on failure. This slightly odd looking function is useful when
writing code that needs to trawl through the models for a number of classes,
see code in w7/fmapgene.c which needs to dynamically examine the database
models and record which classes contain certain tags.


<a name="aquila"></a><H3>Aquila changes</H3>

<P>Rob Clack has been making more changes to our build/test system to further
improve its automation and save us work in the future. He has also fixed a
number of problems as Sanger systems have migrated to new levels of Linux, OSF
etc.
