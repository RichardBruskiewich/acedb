<P>A short newsletter this month as most work has been on the new ZMap code
which will form the new split off FMap client.

<P>Highlights for this month include: Acedb can now be compiled with either
GTK version 1 or 2 now that GTK2 is available on the Alphas,
ZMap can now be compiled into xace/Acedb or run as a stand alone client,
several significant FMap/GFF enhancements/fixes were made to support Wormbase,
plus a number of fixes to Blixem to support the Otter/lace system.

<a name="GTK"></a><H3>GTK versions 1 and 2</H3>

<P>Thanks to Simon Kelley we now have a provisional/testable installed GTK2 and
acedb can be compiled and run with this new version of the toolkit both on linux
and the Alphas.

<P>Acedb users can choose to build with GTK1 or 2 and either from our own
distributed versions of the libraries or from their own system installed ones.



<a name="Aceconn"></a><H3>AceConn error message routine</H3>

<P>The AceConn error message routines have been revamped
so that just one routine returns all
error messages whether they are the simple hard coded ones or the
dynamically constructed "last error" messages held within each AceConn
control block.

<a name="GFF"></a><H3>Improved GFF dumping</H3>

<P>Improvements/fixes should lead to substantial throughput gains for worm builds
as non-essential data is filtered out and not dumped at all. Special HOMOL_GAP segs
were created to support joining up homologies with lines (in much the same way
that exons are joined up but intron lines), these mean nothing in biological terms
so are filtered out which hugely reduces the size of GFF output files.

<P>A number of improvements have been made
to the way the Method object and Feature object data is handled, especially
for features that have a parent-child structure such as transcripts where records
must be written both for the overall feature and for its constituent parts.

<a name="smap_bug"></a><H3>SMap bug with Align tag</H3>

<P>Fix bug in the way we position stuff that has the Align tag set, we were
not calculating the length correctly. This led to the end coordinate being
truncated by the offset specified in the child start as specified following
the Align tag. In this case the child contained DNA and so had its own explicit
length which should have been used to correctly calculate the offset and length
in the child.

<P>This feels like a missing bit of design.
We need to look for DNA and use this as an explicit length of an object,
if there is no DNA we need to use whichever is the longer of the position
in the parent or the maximum extent of the children.

<a name="zmap_work"></a><H3>ZMap Work</H3>

<P>The stand alone library has been reworked so that the ZMap window code can be
compiled either into xace or into the stand alone client without code
modification. This will allow testing of the interface from within xace and
the existing Otter/lace system in parallel with continuing development of the
stand alone client.

<P>The stand alone client is threaded and can be compiled as a C++ executable to
allow use of the more extensive C++ libraries available for handling XML
datastreams.

<P>Work is also continuing on providing acedb routines to interface to the ZMap
code when compiled directly into xace.




<a name="zmap_work"></a><H3>Build/Test</H3>

<P>There have been a number of general build/test improvements to provide better
automation of testing in line with slimming down the effort required for daily
maintenance of Acedb.
