<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - October 2003</H1>


<!-- ******************************************************************** -->

<P>After a bit of a shake down caused by the departure of Simon Kelley from the
Acedb team we've decided that we will continue to send out a monthly newsletter
and do a monthly build. Although we have cut down enormously on how much we
are working on acedb, its still enough to warrant continuing with the builds
and newsletters.

<P>This newsletter sees the last contributions to acedb from Simon Kelley and
describes a number of changes to support the increasing use of different classes
to make virtual sequences for display/annotation via FMap or dumping as GFF.
We are moving on to GTK version 2 at long last. And there are a number of bug fixes.

<a name="superclass"></a><H3>Composite classes: the opposite of Subclasses</H3>

<P>As a parting shot Simon Kelley implemented a mechanism for allowing you
to create collections of database classes that can be queried as a unit.
You could for example clump all your Smap'd classes into a single composite
class to make running queries easier. Here's a brief description of how you
do this courtesy of Simon:

<P>"Composite classes" behave in the Query language and the Acedb Main
window like a superclass of their members.

<P>They are called "Composite classes" because we already have a concept                  
of superclasses which are the inverse of subclasses.                                    

<P>To make a Composite class:                                                              
                                                                                       
<P>You need to add the class to subclasses.wrm (I know, I know, it's like using the
"Start" menu to shut down the computer.) There is a new tag in Class class                
called "Composite_of", so to make a Composite class called "Interesting"                
which is all Sequences and Loci add the following to subclasses.wrm

<pre><code>Class Interesting                                                                       
Visible                                                                                 
Composite_of Sequence                                                                   
Composite_of Locus                                                                      
</code></pre>

<P>The new class behaves like a protected class (you can't create objects                 
of that class) but you can query it and select it in the main window.                   

<P>Unfortunately there will be no AQL support for the foreable future.



<a name="temp_genes"></a><H3>Gene Finder changes: Making Temp Genes</H3>

<P>If you don't use the Gene finder facility built into FMap then there's
probably not much point in reading this.

<P>The introduction of the SMap tags into acedb has meant that it is now possible
to construct virtual sequences for display by FMap not just from Sequence
class objects, but from any classes the user has embedded the SMap tags in.
This has meant changes to Acedb in a number of places to generalise the
code to handle any number of classes.

<P>The Gene finder facility allows the user to create new "gene" objects to
match the exons/splice site information produced by the Gene Finder code.
Previously these objects could only be Sequence class objects, now they
could be any one of a number of classes. The "Selected -> temp_gene" menu
item now gives a submenu allowing the user to select the class of the
temp_gene to be created. To be included in the submenu a class must contain
the <b>S_Parent</b> and <b>Source_Exons</b> tags, i.e. the class must be
mappable and able to represent exons in the usual acedb style.

<P>The code that fixes and removes temporary genes
has also been altered to cope with 
temp_gene_N objects of different classes.

<P>An earlier attempt to allow different class objects to be created relied
on the user setting a USE_CDS_CLASS preference, this is now redundant and
has been removed from the preferences list.

<a name="GTK2"></a><H3>GTK 2: moving on with the times</H3>

<P>GTK has been our underlying widget set (i.e. the library that provides sliders,
buttons etc.) for some years now. Up until recently acedb was only compiled with
GTK version 1 which is now substantially out of date.

<P>Accordingly we have put some effort (thanks to Simon for getting this all going)
into getting acedb to compile with GTK version 2. The newer version has many bug
fixes and improvements but has required a number of code and build changes.

<P>The build changes are encapsulated in scripts in w3rdparty/ and the usual
wmake/XXXX_DEF files. For now the relevant wmake/XXXX_DEF files contain
"GTK2" as part of their file name, e.g. LINUX_GTK2_4_DEF. We have provided
DEF files for Linux and Alpha builds.


<a name="fmap_smap"></a><H3>FMap changes</H3>

<P>As users incorporate new classes into their sequence data to replace
the old monolithic Sequence class based data there have had to be a number
of changes to the FMap. Its likely that these changes will continue for
some time to come. Latest changes include:

<ul>
  <li>When you double click on any box in the FMap window that is derived from
      an SMap'd object, that object will be shown in the Tree display.
  <li>The blue information line at the top of the Fmap now shows both the class
      and object name for a box in the format "Class:name", e.g. "Sequence:B0250".
      This is necessary now that boxes can be derived from objects of many different
      classes.
</ul>

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>


<a name="dotter"></a><H3>Small Dotter change</H3>

<P>In response to a frequent user request, fullscreen crosshairs are now the default.


<a name="find_tree"></a><H3>Find bug in Tree display</H3>

<P>Fixed bug whereby a failed Find didn't give an error message.



<a name="fmap_bugs"></a><H3>FMap bugs</H3>

<P>Fixed horrible bug in fmap window title, same old dangling text pointer issues.
This bug caused window title to sometimes be garbage because pointer that name(key)
returned was no longer pointing to the name of the key.

<P>Yet more horrid text pointer stuff, we were passing blixem the pointer
returned by name(key), the blixem code then truncated this text directly
because it didn't take a copy of the text, this changed the text in the
lex thus actually changing the name of the object in the database !
This didn't show up before because most object names were sufficiently short
that blixem did not truncate them for display, the Otter/lace system at
Sanger creates long object names automatically for its assemblies and this
revealed the bug.


<a name="socket_bug"></a><H3>Server bug</H3>

<P>Fixed bug in socket layer: I misunderstood how much shutdown() does for you,
I thought it closed the file as well as stopping the TCP connection. This
turns out not to be true, you need to explicitly close the connection after
the shutdown. I think this is fixed but the command that lets you monitor
how many files a process has open is su root so I can't check this..sigh.

<a name="composite_function"></a><H3>New Pick function for Composite classes</H3>

<P>Simon Kelley says:

<P>For programming, I've added one function                                                
                                                                                        
<P><code>BOOL pickBelongsToComposite(KEY classe, KEY key)                                        
</code>

<P>classe can either be a small integer from pickWord2Class or a Key in                    
Class class. The function returns TRUE of key is in classe. It's legal                  
to call it with either composite or ordinary classes.                                   
                                                                                     



<a name="smapconvert_works"></a><H3>Various sMapConvert() bits</H3>

<P>The introduction of multiple classes has required a number of changes
to the smap code, this is a sample of the type of work that's had to
be done:

<ul>
  <li>Exon code needs to make an artificial "parent" seg for non-sequence class
      exons/introns otherwise bumping algorithm doesn't work. This feels like a hack.
  <li>Fixed confirmed introns code which did not deal with when smap call failed
      in the right way, looks like a v. old bug to me.
  <li>Fix convertAllele() so that it gets the Method correctly for non-sequence
      class alleles.
  <li>Change main convert loop to remove code that makes sequence segs to a
      subroutine, otherwise processing is v. complex for classes other than
      a sequence.
  <li>Add data to conv_info for smapped position of current obj, needs to be
      passed to convert routines for classes other than sequence.
</ul>


<a name="aquila"></a><H3>Aquila</H3>

<P>These changes are courtesy of Rob Clack.

<P>Added better support to Aquila for which executable is run, e.g. tace, giface etc.

<P>Aquila requires the Mail package and now warns if its not available.

<P>gff tests added, very important now many different classes are being
SMap'd and then dumped.
