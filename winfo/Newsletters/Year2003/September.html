<P>This month sees a change in the acedb staff at Sanger which will have
some ramifications, a windows package of blixem and dotter, an article
on text searching in acedb and a number of bug fixes.

<P>A month of change for Acedb at the Sanger Institute.

<P>Simon Kelley, who has been
a stalwart of acedb development for years, is to move on to pastures new working
in the systems group here at Sanger.

<P>Simon has been responsible for a lot of very important acedb features over
the years including the genetic map display and many which, being internal to acedb, have probably passed most
people by. He has been the solver of many horrible bugs and introduced many good things,
not least the move to using the Cygwin/GTK libraries which have enabled us
to port acedb to Windows and the Mac in a sustainable way and use a more modern graphics
system. He will be sorely missed.

<P>Good luck in the new job Simon !

<P><I>(Please see <A HREF="#acedb_future">"The Future of acedb"</A>
for a discussion of what this all means for acedb support and development.)</I>

<a name="blixem_dotter"></a><H3>Blixem/Dotter for Windows</H3>

<P>As a parting shot at Windows support Rob Clack has made a download
package for blixem and dotter. You can grab these stand alone
binaries (i.e. they are independent of acedb) from our
<A HREF="http://www.acedb.org/Software/Downloads/">downloads page</A>.



<a name="make_trouble"></a><H3>Troubles with "make"</H3>

<P>If you build your own acedb then you should probably read this.

<P>Our makefile creates a subdirectory named <b>"bin.XXXXX"</b> where <b>"XXXXX"</b>
is a name representing your machine architecture. In this directory it
makes symbolic links to all the source files to be compiled in the <b>w*</b>
directories. There is a problem with this though in that some versions
of <b>"ln"</b> (the command to create the link) support overwriting an existing
link while others do not.

<P>To fix this we put a test into the makefiles:

<P>test -L xxx.c || ln -s ../wXXXX/xxx.c .

<P>i.e. if the link doesn't exist then make it.

<P>Unfortunately some versions of the sh shell don't support this use
of "test", you can't win can you...sigh.

<P>Now you can set the make macro <b>$(TEST)</b> in your <b>XXXXX_DEF</b> file
to a version on your system that will support this and the makefile will work, e.g.

TEST = /bin/test

<P>and hey presto it should all work.

<a name="acedb_future"></a><H3>The future of acedb</H3>

<P>Owing to the current financial climate it is not anticipated that Simon will
be replaced in the foreseeable future, this means that there will have to be some
changes in what the acedb team at Sanger can do in the way of support, bug fixing
and development.

<P>After some dicussion we have decided to press ahead with the development of
the new Zmap display which will in effect be a client-server version of the FMap. There
are a number of reasons for doing this and there will be more discussion in the
newsletters as we continue this work.

<P>Clearly in order that we can do new development there must be some cuts in
support and development of existing code. We have decided to essentially freeze
our core acedb development and are currently finishing off existing "work in
progress" before Simon leaves.

<P>In more detail the implications of this are:

<ul>
  <li><b>Builds:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Windows support will be dropped with no more Windows builds from
	    this month.
	<li>Un*x and Mac builds will continue.
	<li>Builds will be done as and when new features are added or bugs fixed,
	    there will no longer be the monthly build cycle.
      </ul>
  <li><b>Support:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Newsletters will only appear when there is something to say.
	<li>User group meetings here at Sanger will be when users need to
	    discuss a bug or request new features or when we need to tell
	    users about new code/features/fixes.
	<li>We will continue to try to respond to users questions in the newsgroup
	    and via emails.
      </ul>
  <li><b>Bug fixes:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>will be when necessary or time allows.
      </ul>
  <li><b>Acedb core development:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>All development that is not related to the new display will have to be agreed
	    in advance.
      </ul>
</ul>

<P>This probably all sounds a bit draconian and bleak but realistically we had more
than we could possibly manage with 3 of us and with 2 of us this will be even more
so. The choice is really between making progress or falling into a purely bug-fixing
support role.

<P>A recent user question was:

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know how to query LongText?

<p>It seem in the old versions of xace you can do TextSearch or Grep.  You                  
can still do it now.                                                                     
                                                                                         
<p>Once you have stored LongText away in the database, then it is hard to                   
query it.                                                                                
                                                                                         
<p><code><b>select l from l in class longText</b></code> will return all the keys for LongText.                 
                                                                                         
<p>Is there a way to say                                                                    
                                                                                         
<p><code><b>where l->content_of_longtext like "*my favorite word*"</b></code>
or something like this ?

<P>Jeans has written this reply which deals generally with querying text in acedb
as well as with longtext specifically:


<P><b>Text entry and text searches in acedb</b>

<P>Acedb has 3 types of text fields

<P>None of these are limited in size, the daily aquila regression test reads and writes
Text of 1 megabyte in a length.

<P>Notice that there is no difference between entering a Text and                            
a ?Text. If you dump all papers, remove all citations, read                               
a new model where Citation is declared as ?Text and parse the                             
exact ace file you have just dumped, all citations will be promoted                       
from Text to ?Text.                                                                       
                                                                                          
<P><b>3) Memory cost</b>                                                                            
                                                                                          
<P>The Text entry are stored on disk, inside the object they belong to. They cost            
nothing.                                                                                  
                                                                                          
<P>The ?Text entries are constantly in RAM. Typically, they define the largest               
dictionary in an acedb database. The size is given in the graphic interface by            
going to status, then the submenu "number of object per class". To spend 10 to            
100 Mb on that distionary is probably perfectly ok, depending on your machine.            
Another important cost is that a ?Text is cross referenced in to all the objects          
it belongs to. However acedb slows has linear algorithms and deep recursive               
calls associated to the XREF system. It is therefore costly to XREF over a few            
hundred objects, very costly over say 5000. Therefore, you must really avoid to           
enter in ?Text some sentence shared by thousands of objects. The same is true of          
any other objects. For example, consider the RNAi experiemnts. Well over 10,000           
genes have been tested. About half have a special phenotype, you can store that           
as a ?Text, but for the other half it is much preferable to have a special tag            
called "No_RNAi_phenotype" then to enter those same words as a ?Text pointing             
back to 5000 genes.                                                                       
                                                                                          
<P>?LongText is stored on disk as an independant object but point only to its                
parent. The cost in RAM is the name of the LongText, not its content.

<P>There is always a trade of. The high cost of the ?Text is compensated by the              
ease of querying. The following queries will work:

<P>There is no difference in syntax or in speed between these 2 queries, the speed           
is linear in the number of papers containing the relevant Tag. Each paper has to          
be retreived from disk, so the whole search may be slow. However, for ?Text you           
may also use

<P>This query is solved completelly in RAM, so it will be quasi instantaneous. A             
contrario 'grep *PSWC*' will not work. Finally, longtext may only be queried           
using the xace graphic long search button or the tace command:

This search is linear in the number of LongText entries, one disk access per              
LongText. Notice that "query longgrep " does not work, longrep must be issued at          
the tace prompt, and that Longgrep retrieves ?LongText and ?Text but not Text.

<P>Use Text for things which amy be very repetitive or which do not have to be             
searched out of context. Use ?Text if you wish to use that text as an entry               
point, without knowing the exact class and tag where it is located, or if you             
wish great speed of access.  Use ?LongText for abstarcts.                                 
                                                                                          
<P>We know that the whole system is confusing. In the draft version of acedb.5,            
we have had for several years a system that no longer slows down on very large            
Text, or on very large XREF, and we are working on direct indexing of LongText.           
But for the moment, things work are described above.                                      

                                                                                          
<P><b>More on Querying longText</b>

<P>In acedb, paper abstracts and other long documents are                                    
stored in a special class called LongText. You can list                                   
all those objects by using the query

<pre><code>Find longtext                                                                           
</code></pre>

<P>either from xace or from tace.                                                            
This may be usefull to create a .ace file, but otherwise                                  
it is not very informative, since you just get the                                        
identifiers.                                                                              
                                                                                          
<P>However, it is also possible to search them by content.                                   
From the xace interface, type some words in the main window                              
and select 'even in longtext'.  For example, typing the words                             
'binding proteins' should bring back several papers containing                            
these exact words in their abstract. Typing 'binding*hairpin'                             
may bring back pubmed 9049306, if you have that abstract                                  
in your database, because the * allows to find these 2 words                              
although they are not contiguous, but are in this order.                                  
                                                                                          
<P>The same list can be found in tace by the command longrep, which                          
is described in the command help:

<P>CAVEAT: in tace, after longgrep, do not use "" and do not add terminal white              
spaces                                                                                    
unless you mean it.                                                                       
                                                                                          
<P>HORRIBLE LIMITATION: longrep explores the longtexts and moves back to the parent          
paper with the same identifier. It would be much better if it could move back to          
the parent object of any type of longtext, not just abstract, and even if the             
names differ.                                                                             
                                                                                          
<P>A much more complete text indexing system is in developement. It is driving               
the query system of AceView (http://www.humangenes.org), but for the                      
moment it is schema specific. Since it is wonderfully fast, I hope someday                
to make it general and synchrone. The current implementation needs                        
of line recalculation if the database is edited.

<a name="dna_highlight"></a><H3>DNA highlighting lost in FMap</H3>

<P>A perplexing and bamboozling bug, sometimes the highlighting of the DNA
sequence in FMap just stopped working. This is now fixed.


<a name="reverse_complement"></a><H3>Reusing an FMap and reverse-complementing</H3>

<P>If the FMap code reused an existing FMap display and the old display was reverse-complemented,
but the new object to be displayed was on the reverse strand, then the display needed to be
flipped back from reverse complement mode.


<a name="no_display"></a><H3>No_display tag in Method class</H3>

<P>The Method class has two main uses in acedb, to provide options for displaying
and for dumping any objects that reference that Method. To this end it is
sometimes useful to specify that an object should never be displayed (although it
may be dumped). After a request from Wormbase, the code has been around for some years
to implement this but ironically the tag that controls this behaviour has been missing
from our canonical models.wrm file that we distribute with acedb.

<P>You need to update your Method class like this:

<pre><code>?Method	Remark ?Text
        // the Display information controls how the column looks.
	Display No_display                                      // column is not displayed at all.
                Colour #Colour
                etc. etc.
