<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>
<P>This month was mostly a month of bug fixes with some improvements to
fmap display.

<a name="fmap_display"></a><H3>Better FMap and Tree display interactions</H3>

<P>When displaying objects in the Tree display window, its always been
possible to click on a sequence object key within the tree display and see
the FMap display of that object. The problem with this in the past has been that
in the case where the sequence object is actually the parent of the object in
the tree display the subsequent fmap is not that helpful in that it displays the
whole of the object instead of the part that relates to the object in the
tree display. The acedb display system will now show the sequence object
zoomed and positioned around the object in the tree display.

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>


<a name="embl_file"></a><H3>EMBL file bugs</H3>

<P>The EMBL output code will now dump Transcript class objects (as used in Wormbase)
correctly, they are output in the same way that gene objects are dumped.

<P>The EMBL error message code had a bug in it, it specified a "<code>%d</code>"
instead of "<code>%s</code>" in the format string producing garbage messages.


<a name="gtk_file"></a><H3>GTK file chooser</H3>

<P>The gtk file selector to now correctly retains the file name when
the complete default filename is already known.


<a name="table_bug"></a><H3>Tablemaker output bug</H3>

<P>Fixed bug in tablemaker output file handling, file was not closed until
a) user quit acedb or b) user made another table. Confusing and annoying because
it looks like the file hasn't been written.

<P>I thought I had fixed all the bugs caused by aceOutPrint(fo, ptr_str)
where the string pointed to happens to have a "%" in it, but not so,
hopefully this is the last one. This bug caused tablemaker to fail.

<a name="aceOutPrintStr"></a><H3>New aceOutPrintStr() function</H3>

<P>I've added a new <code>aceOutPrintStr()</code> call for printing simple strings.
This is try and dissuade people from using aceOutPrint() for this purpose which leads to
bugs if the string happens to contain a "%" which is then interpreted as a formatting
instruction with usually bad results.


<a name="msort"></a><H3>qsort/msort routines</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Mieg</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ray.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ray.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>Replaced qsort by self contained msort,
incredibly qsort crashed (rarely but reproducibly) under solaris 5.7
on sparc machines.


<a name="dict"></a><H3>New version of dict</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Mieg</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ray.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ray.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>Wonderful new version of the dict with stable memory
that means after you add in dict and get a name out of the dict
that char* is stable until the dict is destroyed.
Whereas before it went out of scope if by chance
the dict was realocted by an implicit arrayExpand.

<P>All the relocatable memory addresses are now fully
hidden from the user by the modified obscure dict.h

<P>Truly, it is a tremendous improvement !!!


<a name="smap_area"></a><H3>SMap "area"</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Simon Kelley</I>
<A HREF="mailto:srk@sanger.ac.uk">srk@sanger.ac.uk</A>)

<P>Added new facility to specify "area". Any object completely outside
the area is elided, and sMapDNA returns DNA only for the area.

<P><code>sMapCreate()</code> sets the area to be the whole smap, so backwards
compatibility is ensured. <code>sMapCreateEx()</code> allows setting the area.
Note that the area is specficied in terms of the smap coordinate
system, ie 1-based and with area1 &lt; area2 always.
