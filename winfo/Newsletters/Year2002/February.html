<P>In this issue: new builds of acedb for latest SGIs, some useful acedb
data processing scripts, acedb incorporates the LGPL licence and some
bug fixes.

<P>This month once again sees us buried deep in the new SMap code, converting
the virtual sequence building code to use the new tags while maintaining
compatibility with the old Sequence tags. One more time, we hope to have working
code sometime soon.

<a name="SGI"></a><H3>SGI builds of acedb</H3>

<P>Acedb now builds on SGI Ultrix 6.5, to compile for this version
of the operating system you should set the ACEDB_MACHINE environment
variable to SGI_65_GCC.

<P>Thanks to Jeroen van Gastel &lt;Jeroen-van.Gastel@unilever.com&gt; and
Stefan Verhoeven &lt;Stefan.Verhoeven@unilever.com&gt; of Unilever
for providing the necessary changes to the code and makefile.


<a name="ace2line"></a><H3>New/old acedb tool - ace2line & line2ace utilities</H3>

<P>Dave Matthews recently sent me a couple of useful awk scripts for processing
AceDB data prompted by a users question on the acedb newsgroup. Let us know
(<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>)
if they prove useful or have bugs or whatever.

<P><B>Acknowledgements:</B> The scripts were written in awk in 1992
by Cornel Lee at the Lawrence Berkeley
Lab. (his address at that time was &lt;clee@genome.lbl.gov&gt;).
Dave Matthews (&lt;matthews@greengenes.cit.cornell.edu&gt;)
kindly forwarded the scripts to be included with the
AceDB CVS repository.

<P><b>Synopsis</b>ace2line.awk converts ACEDB .ace files to tab-delimited tables.
line2ace.awk performs the reverse conversion.
See also documentation at the top of the scripts.

<P><b>Description</b>This is a widely useful functionality and there is a script to do it.
It was written for our project by Cornel Lee at LBL some years ago.

<P>It's called ace2line.awk and its purpose is to
select fields in arbitrary order from .ace file and create
line-records.

<P>The hard part about converting .ace data to CSV/tab-delimited is dealing
with 1) multivalued fields and 2) compound (vector) fields.  The script
seems to do reasonable things for these.

<a name="wscripts"></a><H3>File permissions for wscripts scripts</H3>

<P>If you are a database administrator or you are involved in the setting up
of a wscripts directory within a database then you should read this note.

<P>The scripts in wscripts are called from various parts of the acedb
code, for this to work the scripts themselves must be executable by the
user running the script. A recent user problem turned out to be caused
by a script not having the execute flag turned on (you can see this using
the "ls-l" command). You will probably want to make sure that anyone
can execute the script and you can do this by:

<P><code><pre>cd wscripts
chmod ugo+x the_script_name
</pre></code>

<P>This will allow anyone to run the script, if you want to restrict the script
to the user and group for the script you should specify just "ug" instead of "ugo"
in the above example.


<a name="LGPL"></a><H3>AceDB changes its license</H3>

<P>Acedb has been licensed under the Gnu Public License (GPL) for some years
now which means that the code is freely available to all but cannot be filched
for commercial gain and that authors must be acknowledged. This license has a
major drawback however in that it effectively prevents the use of the licensed
code in any form in commercial software. As this was restricting the spread of
GPL code (synonymous with "open source software"), a new less restrictive license
was produced which meant libraries consisting of GPL code could be incorporated
into programs sold for profit provided the inclusion of GPL code was acknowledged.

<P>Acedb has now moved on to this less restrictive form of licensing allowing
greater use of the code for commercial programs.

<a name="Table_maker"></a><H3>Tablemake bug in batch mode.</H3>

<P>There was a bug in tablemaker which caused the first line of the table
to clash with the prompt in batch mode.

<a name="tace_dna"></a><H3>Bug in flags to "dna" command in tace.</H3>

<P>The bug in tace that caused the "-mismatch" flag to be interpreted as
a filename has been fixed.

<a name="genefinder"></a><H3>Crash in gene finder.</H3>

<P>A bug in genefinder caused it to crash if used on objects where no dna was
available, now an error message is displayed.


<a name="cygwin"></a><H3>Grim CYGWIN bug.</H3>

<P>Set a registry key to increase available cygwin heap space from the
deafult 128MB. currently tp 256MB, which is enough for wormbase.
