<a name="General_News"></a><H2>General News</H2>

<P>A short newsletter but a busy month, we are currently working hard on
SMap, a replacement for the conversion routines in the FMap code that
build virtual sequences and their features. Next months newsletter will
contain a full article on SMap.

<a name="New_Features"></a><H2>New Features</H2>

<a name="smap_cometh"></a><H3>Smap is coming</H3>

<P>After a long, long time we are very close to completely replacing the existing
fmap routines that construct virtual sequences with some new routines that use
a new set of tags to mark up sequences. the new tags form part of the SMap system
which will completely replace the Structure tags of the current Sequence class:

<pre><code>	  Structure  From	Source UNIQUE ?Sequence
				Source_Exons Int UNIQUE Int // start at 1
		     Subsequence ?Sequence XREF Source UNIQUE Int UNIQUE Int
</code></pre>

<P>The new SMap system will provide a much more powerful and flexible system
for building up sequence/feature relationships. There will be a full article
on this in the February newsletter and the code will be generally available
in the February release.

<a name="no_display_block"></a><H3>Irritating dialogs</H3>

<P>Recently a user reported that every time they clicked on an "object" field
in the "update" tree window an annoying dialog popped up telling them to <b>"Select
an object by double-clicking as though you were going to display it."</b>, they then
had to click on the <b>"Remove"</b> button in this window to get rid of it.

<P>By default acedb shows these popup windows whenever the user has selected an
option that requires an answer before they can proceed, it's a warning really to
say "you must answer this before you can carry on.". You can disable this via
your user preferences, you need to turn on the <b>"NO_MESSAGE_WHEN_DISPLAY_BLOCK"</b>
preference. You can get to the preferences menu from the "Admin" menu on the
main window. When turned on this preference tells acedb not to bother showing
these warning popup messages.


<a name="homol_pfetch"></a><H3>Using pfetch to get EMBL entries for homologies in fmap</H3>

<P>When you right click on a homolgy in fmap you get a menu that includes
options to show alignments and also to efetch the EMBL entry for the homolgy. There
is now an extra option which allows you to use pfetch instead of efetch
to get the EMBL entry. pfetch will become the preferred option for retrieving
these entries at the Sanger Centre in the future.


<a name="reopen_log"></a><H3>A new "-reopen" option for acedb log files</H3>

<P>There are a number of Unix utilities (e.g. "rotatelogs") that provide general log file handling
services. These usually rely on the programs that create and use the logs to have
an option to close and then reopen the log file. This allows the utility to rename the
open logfile,
tell the program to close and reopen the file, with the result that the program will now
be writing to a new log file and the utility is free to operate on the old log file.

<p>A new "-reopen" option has been added to the "newlog" and "Serverlog"
commands which simply closes and reopens
the log files. This allows acedb logs to then be handled by the Unix log utilities.


<a name="database_perms"></a><H3>Reinitialising the Database</H3>

<P>Previously the following tests have been applied to say whether you could
reinitialise an acedb database:

<ol>
  <li>Your real and effective unix userids must be the same, this will only affect you
      if your versions of the acedb programs have a setuid or setgid bit set.
  <li>The <code><b>wspec/passwd.wrm</b></code> file must exist and be readable.
  <li>You must own the <code><b>wspec/passwd.wrm</b></code> file.
  <li>Your userid must be listed in <code><b>wspec/passwd.wrm</b></code>.
</ol>

<P>This creates a problem if there are a group of you working on a database and you
would like to be able to reinitialise the database without having to <code><b>"su"</b></code>
to the userid of the owner of <code><b>wspec/passwd.wrm</b></code>.

<P>To get round this a new <code><b>"GROUP_ADMIN"</b></code> option has been added to
the <code><b>wspec/database.wrm</b></code> file. When this option is uncommented in
this file then any user who is in the unix group for the <code><b>wspec/database.wrm</b></code>
will also be able to reinitialise the database.

<P>In other words step 3 above will now be:

<ul>
  <li>You must own the <code><b>wspec/passwd.wrm</b></code> file
      or if the GROUP_ADMIN option was set in <code><b>wspec/database.wrm</b></code>
      you must be in the unix group for the password file.
</ul>

<P>Note that the permissions for the database/ subdirectory of your database
must be set to "rws" for the group if this is to work. That is, the group must
have read, write and execute permissions for the subdirectory and in addition
the sticky bit for group permissions on the directory must also be set. This
will ensure that all files <i><b>created</b></i> in the subdirectory will have the same
group as the subdirectory itself.

<P>For example, assuming that "joe"
owns the database and "bloggs" is the group then an "ls -l" of the database
should show the following permissions for the database/ subdirectory:

<pre><code>  drwxrwsr-x   6 joe      bloggs      8192 Feb 13 12:51 database
</code></pre>

<a name="another_banal_filsubs"></a><H3>Another banal file pathname function</H3>

<P>Another banal pathname function has been added to filsubs, this one returns the base filename
part of a given path:

<pre><code>  Given   "/some/load/of/directories/filename.something.ext"
returns   "filename.something"
</code></pre>

<P>i.e. it lops off the directory and the _last_ extension.

<H2>No January monthly build</H2>

<P>Due to problems with our build system and some large scale and unfinished
changes to introduce Smap (see February issue) we were not able to produce
a January monthly build. Sorry !
