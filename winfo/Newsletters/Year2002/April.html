<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - April 2002</H1>


<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.


<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>
<P>This month sees some new features to support driving of acedb programs
from scripts, some Gene Finder changes and as usual some bug fixes.


<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>
<a name="General_News"></a><H2>General News</H2>

<P>We continue to work on the introduction of the new SMap code which is
taking some time as it has many anticipated and many unanticipated (!)
effects on the FMap code in particular.


<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>
<a name="New_Features"></a><H2>New Features</H2>

<a name="Save_write"></a><H3>New "Save" and "WriteAccess" commands/options</H3>

<P>Previously users have had more control over saving and write access when
using xace (e.g. "Save session and keep write access")
than with the command line tace and giface programs. New options have been
added to the "Save" command and a new "WriteAccess" command has been added:

<pre><code>Save : [-drop | -regain]
    Save current state otherwise the system saves every 600 seconds
       -drop   (default) drop write access after saving
       -regain regain write access after saving

Writeaccess : [-gain | -drop [save | nosave]]
    Set write access status
       -gain (default) get write access
       -drop lose write access, with or without saving
</code></pre>

<P>These commands are particularly useful for scripts that need to update a
database and perhaps need to hold on to write access while parsing in several
files of data.


<a name="xremote"></a><H3>New options for giface commands to give more power to xremote</H3>

<P>The giface program allows the creation of "virtual" displays (e.g. fmap, gmap)
and then the dumping of those displays in various formats, e.g. GFF, postscript,
etc. Perhaps less well known is that xace can be driven by the same commands
via the xremote program distributed with AceDB.

<P>For instance:

<pre><code>xremote -remote 'gif ; seqget bA314N13 ; seqdisplay'</code>
</pre>

<P>Will get you an FMap of clone bA314N13 displayed by xace (you must have xace running
<b>before</b> you issue the xremote command.

<P>This mechansim is used as a core part of the <b>"lace"</b> annotation tool maintained by
James Gilbert
<A href="mailto:jgrg@sanger.ac.uk">James Gilbert &lt;jgrg@sanger.ac.uk&gt;</A>
for the human annotation project at the Sanger Institute.

<P>The new options include:

<pre><code><b>seqdisplay</b> ..... [-new] [-title title]
     Works on current sequence, use gif or ps to actually dump the display
        -new     make a new sequence, current one is preserved (for use only with xremote currently)
        -title   give your own title to the sequence
</code></pre>

<pre><code><b>seqrecalc</b>
     Causes the sequence to be recalculated for the active graph
</code></pre>


<P>You could for example use the new commands/options to construct a script which:

<ol>
  <li>Starts up an xace for the user, and then automatically displays a sequence
      in an fmap:
<pre><code>xremote -remote 'gif ; seqget sequence_name ; seqdisplay'</code>
</pre>
  <li>Adds new data into the database and gets the fmap to recalculate and show
      the new data by:
<pre><code>xremote -remote 'gif ; seqrecalc'</code>
</pre>
  <li>Replaces the sequence in the fmap with a new sequence:
<pre><code>xremote -remote 'gif ; seqget new_sequence_name ; seqdisplay'</code>
</pre>
  <li>Displays a new sequence in an entirely new fmap (which becomes the current fmap, the existing
  current one is preserved):
<pre><code>xremote -remote 'gif ; seqget another_sequence_name ; seqdisplay -new -title "Super New Sequence'</code>
</pre>
</ol>

<H2>March monthly build not available.</H2>

<P>Apologies, once again there was no build this month due to the major
SMap development work.

<a name="gfcode"></a><H3>Gene Finder changes</H3>

<P><A HREF="mailto:klh@sanger.ac.uk">Kevin Howe &lt;klh@sanger.ac.uk&gt;</A>
has made some changes to the Gene Finder code (originally written by Phil
Green of Washington University Medical School) which while not strictly
affecting acedb are worth documenting here (most of the changes affect
the stand alone version of the gene finder code).

<P>Kevins comments:

<P>You can do a diff on the file yourself to see what I've changed. The
standalone-only stuff I've protected with "#ifndef ACEDB", but I'll
just summarise the other changes here:

<ol>
  <li>The array "cumVec" is now double instead of float (and this has
      some knock-on effects in places where this array is used/passed,
      parameter types etc). This is because the float precision is
      inadequate for sequences more than 10kb or so. You may want to change
      this back.
  <li>I've changed the constant SEGSCORECUTOFF from a #define to a static
      float. This is so that the value can be modified by a command-line
      option in the standalone version.
  <li>The main calculation of the coding segments and genefinder features
      in "aceFeatures" and "aceSites" is now protected with checks that
      that tables for each site-type are non-null. This will have no
      impact in ACEDB, because the tables are always non-null, but I've
      extended the standalone version to be more flexible in what it
      expects in the tables file. If you don't want ATG predictions, then
      you can make a tables file with no ATG tables, and the code will now
      happily not try to predict ATGs.
  <li>In aceMaxSegs, there was a mistake which meant that some GF_CODING
      segments were calculated in the wrong frame, which I've fixed.  In
      aceFeatures, I also added a fix which ensures that coding segments
      that bridge a stop codon are broken into two segments, one either
      side. I discussed this one with Richard and he agreed that this is
      the now the correct behaviour.
</ol>

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>


<a name="show_as"></a><H3>Inappropriate "Show As" actions</H3>

<P>The code to decide what to do when a user tried to display an object
from the keyset window when the "Show as" display type was incorrect did not
always work very sensibly or, in some cases, did not work at all.

<P>The code to decide what to do when there was an object/display type mismatche
was scattered across some 15 files which compounded the problem.
All the code to choose what to do is now in display.c and takes a consistent
series of steps to cope with this problem, ending with the Tree display if no other
appropriate display can be found. In addition the
code will now warn the user when the object simply cannot be displayed.


<a name="restriction"></a><H3>Buglet in restriction dialog for Fmap</H3>

<P>The search pattern in the dialog box is now also reset to blank when the
user clicks the "clear" button.


<a name="gff_dump"></a><H3>Bad bug in the GFF dumper.</H3>

<P>A change in the way the strings that hold an objects name are handled
caused the GFF dumper to reference deallocated storage when printing out
the objects name, now fixed.

<P>If you wish to make comments/suggestions about any of the below, please mail them
to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>


<a name="bindex"></a><H3>Replacing bIndexFind() with bIndexTag()</H3>

<P>The bindex package in acedb provides a call to use the index to test
whether a particular tag exists in an object:

<pre><code>BindexFindResult bIndexFind(KEY originalKey, KEY tag) ;</code>
</pre>

<P>But there is a trap for the unwary here in that the call can return
one of three possible values (BINDEX_TAG_ABSENT, BINDEX_TAG_UNCLEAR, BINDEX_TAG_PRESENT)
and its very easy to forget this and write code that assumes that a Boolean value is
returned:

<pre><code>if (bIndexFind(key,tag))</code>
</pre>

<P>This call will sometimes return BINDEX_TAG_UNCLEAR and sometimes BINDEX_TAG_PRESENT
with consequent confusion in the code following the test.

<P>In fact Jean had already added some functions (keyGetNNN) to bssubs.c
to use bIndexFind() but then open the object and look for the tag if the
return from bIndexFind() was BINDEX_TAG_UNCLEAR. These calls returned an unambiguous
Boolean value to indicate whether the tag was present or absent.

<P>These calls have now been renamed and moved to bindex.c as it seems more logical/obvious
for them to be with bIndexFind, they are:


<P><code><b>BOOL bIndexTag(KEY key, KEY tag) ;</b></code>

<P>returns <b>TRUE</b> if <b>tag</b> is found in object <b>key</b>.

<P><code><b>BOOL bIndexGetKey(KEY key, KEY tag, KEY *key_out) ;</b></code>

<P>returns <b>TRUE</b> if
<b>tag</b> is found in object <b>key</b> and will return the key following <b>tag</b>
in <b>key_out</b> if <b>key_out</b> is non-NULL.
