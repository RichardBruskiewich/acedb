<P><hr width="62%" align=left>

<P>This month sees some improvements to the "gif smap" commands, to column
overlap control in FMap and to EMBL dumping. There are some performance
improvements to the socket server and some improvements to SMap, a bug fix
and for developers some improvements to the ACEIO package.

<a name="gif_smap"></a><H3>Improvements to "gif smap" command</H3>

<P>The "<code>smap</code>" command available from the the "<code>gif</code>" submenu allows you to map the
coordinates from one sequence into the coordinate frame of another related sequence.
The format of the command is:

<pre><code>smap -coords x1 x2 -from class:object -to class:object
</code></pre>

<P>If you do not specify the <code><b>-to</b></code> argument it now defaults
to the root of the smap tree containing the -from sequence.

<P>If you do not specify the <code><b>-coords</b></code> argument it now defaults
to the start and stop coordinates of the -from sequence.


<a name="col_overlap"></a><H3>Improvements to column overlap mode in xace</H3>

<P>The different columns in the fmap correspond to the different Method objects
in the database, on the forward strand they are given the name of the Method
object, on the reverse strand the name is prepended with a "-". Some of the
Method object data is shared for both columns, some is column specific. Up until
now the overlap mode was shared which meant that if you selected "bump" it would
be applied to both forward and reverse strands which could be very irritating as
the whole display would be shifted by a large amount to the right. Now overlap
mode can be set independently for the forward and reverse strands. The mode is
specific to the strand so that if you select "overlap" for the reverse strand,
then it will remain as overlap when you for instance reverse complement the display.


<a name="embl_dump_logic"></a><H3>Changes to the EMBL dumping code within AceDB</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Dan Lawson</I>
<A HREF="mailto:dl1@sanger.ac.uk">dl1@sanger.ac.uk</A>)


<P>AceDB has the ability to dump a genome sequence in
EMBL format. One facet of this code is the addition
of /note qualifies for matching EST/mRNA transcript
evidence to a CDS feature. AceDB 4.7 checked whether
each of the cross-reference EST objects had a
Database line with an EMBL accession and would output
one of the following:

<P><pre> if the EST has an EMBL accession stored.

      /note="cDNA EST EMBL:D72339 comes from this gene"

 else the object name is returned.

      /note="cDNA EST yk97e6.3 comes from this gene"
</pre>

<P>AceDB 4.9 no longer performs this check and will always
return a note line which use the AceDB object name.

<P><pre>e.g.  /note="cDNA EST yk97e6.3 comes from this gene"
</pre>

<P>This ensures that a curator has control over the
transcript name in the EMBL file such that consistency
is maintained within the AceDB namespace rather than
the EMBL namespace.

<a name="socket_server"></a><H3>Socket server performance improvements</H3>

<P>A while ago a request was received to add time stamps to each log file
message written by the server which seems reasonable. Unfortunately this
turned out to be a very bad idea performance-wise since the operation
of finding the current time is always very expensive. This simple change
had a major impact on server performance, especially where a client issued
a whole series of AceDB commands, each one requiring a time stamp !

<P>Having a timestamp for every log message is now optional, the default
is to have them only for session start/end messages. In the future an option
will be added to allow the server administrator to specify a timestamp
per every NN messages.

<P>Socket server performance is now significantly better than the RPC based
AceDB 4_7 server.



<a name="smap_design"></a><H3>A Change to smap design</H3>

<P>There was a design problem with sMap: it could not encode strand infomation for
single-base mappings.

<P>In addition there was an implementation problem where a mapping with a
single-base DNA block as a result of the uncertain strand mapping would sometimes be
complemented incorrectly.

<P>The following changes have been made to SMap:

<ul>
  <li>Allow a single-base mapping on the reverse strand to be represented
      in the database like this:

      <P>S_Child tag2 100 100 Align 100 1 -1
      <P>
      
  <li>Track strands though the sMap data structures.

  <li>Provide a new call: sMapIsReverse(info, x1, x2)

      <P>This takes the same arguments as sMapMap and disambiguates the case
      were the output from sMapMap has <code><b>y1==y2</b></code>. In the cases where the result
      of calling sMapMap is <code><b>y1!=y2</b></code> this function just returns TRUE when
      <code><b>y1&gt;y2</b></code> and FALSE otherwise.
      <P>
</ul>

<P>These changes fix the one-base mapping and DNA complementing problems.

<a name="xremote_bug"></a><H3>Fix xremote problems with driving FMap</H3>

<P>Fixed bug in code to support xremote calls to fmap routines, the
current fmap graph in the display system was not reset correctly
after destroying an fmap which is to be replaced by a new one.

<a name="acein_out"></a><H3>Improvements to AceIn/AceOut package</H3>

<P>The AceIn/Out packages could be expensive to use in the case where
the caller wanted to replace the text in an existing AceIn/Out object,
to do this required destroying the existing object and recreating a new
one with the new text. This was expensive for instance in the server
where new commands are constantly read in and new replies sent out.

<P>Two new calls have been added which allow replacement of existing text
with new text in an existing AceIn or AceOut
object. The calls are:

<pre><code>void aceInSetNewText(ACEIN fi, char *text, char *params) ;

void aceOutSetNewStack(ACEOUT fo, Stack s) ;
</code></pre>
