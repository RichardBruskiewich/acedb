<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter -  May 2000</H1>

<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<P>This month includes a tip about what to do if your queries seem not to be
working correctly (thanks to Lisa French for raising this), a change to the
way acedb programs find their help files, yet more fmap stuff (cascading menus
for column configuration) and a change to acedb user group meetings.

<a name="General"></a><H2>General News</H2>

<p>The latest monthly release is now available from <code>~acedb/RELEASE.DEVELOPMENT</code>.


<a name="New"></a><H2>New Features</H2>

<a name="Finding"></a><h3>Finding acedb configuration and help files...</h3>

<p>Simon Kelley has added code to help with providing common configuration/help files
for multiple databases.
Acedb programs will now search in two directories: the database directory
itself and an installation-wide directory where
default copies of help files and config files and scripts can exist.
These are used when the files cannot be found in the database directory.

<P>The database directory is found as before from the command line, or the
value of $ACEDB. The installation-wide directory is found on unix from the value of $ACEDB_COMMON, or
/usr/share/acedb, or /usr/local/acedb (in that order), on windows it is found from a
registry entry set up by the installation program on windows.

<p>This now makes it possible to put common acedb files in to a single directory on the
system and find them by setting $ACEDB_COMMON in the users shell environment. This can be
used to replace the existing mechanism of maintaining symbolic links within database
directories.

<p>The following resources will be searched for in the installation-wide directory if not
found in the database:

<pre><code>
wspec/wingtkrc
wspec/gtkrc
wspec/winfonts.wrm
wspec/xfonts.wrm
wspec/psfonts.wrm
wspec/acedbrc
wspec/table.menu
wspec/sysclass.wrm
wspec/displays.wrm
wspec/table.menu
wscripts/*
whelp/*
</code></pre>

<p>Note that acedb will use only the contents of $ACEDB/whelp or
$ACEDB_COMMON/whelp, <b>it won't mix files from both</b>.

<p>The following are searched for only in the database dir.

<pre><code>
database/*
rawdata/*
wquery/*
rawdata/*
wgf/*
wspec/layout.wrm
wspec/models.wrm
wspec/constraints.wrm
wspec/subclasses.wrm
wspec/lock.wrm
wspec/serverconfig.wrm
wspec/serverpasswd.wrm
wspec/server.wrm
wspec/datainfo.wrm
wspec/options.wrm
wspec/passwd.wrm
wspec/database.wrm
</code></pre>


<a name="Specifying"></a><h3>Specifying a database directory from xace...</h3>

<p>Simon has also introduced a new command line option to xace which allows you
to choose a database when you start xace.

<p>If you type:

<pre><code>
xace -promptdb
</code></pre>

<p>you will prompted to choose a database directory via the usual "file chooser"
type window.


<a name="fmap"></a><h3>fmap cascading menus...</h3>

<p>Fmap column configuration via <B>Column pull down menus</B> was covered in the
last newsletter but this unfortunately did not work correctly. If several columns of
different kinds were drawn over the top of each other, only one of the columns could
be manipulated via the pull down menus. This months code fixes this by providing
a cascading pull down menu which shows all the columns drawn in one position and
allows separate configuration of all those columns. Try it out and if you have
problems send mail to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.


<a name="Query"></a><H2>Query not working any more...</H2>

<p>Lisa French reported a problem with a number of queries just not working
correctly. Investigation showed that the database indexing (which provides rapid
accessing of object field/tags) was incorrect, this does not mean the database
will lose data but it does mean that queries do not work correctly until the next
full reindex of the database.

<p>tace provides a "read models" command optionally with a full reindex, this option
has now been added to xace as well (on the main panel, click the "Edit.." button
and select the "Read Models and full reindex" option). If you are having
problems with queries clearly not working correctly then you should try reindexing
the database. Before you do this you should note two points:
<ol>
  <li>You must be able to get write access to the database.
  <li>A complete reindex can take some time and no one else
      will be able to update the database while this is happening.
</ol>

<p>This problem shouldn't happen and we hope to fix it soon, you should only suspect
that your database is corrupted if reindexing does not fix the problem.


<a name="User"></a><H2>User Group meetings</H2>

<p>Acedb user group meetings happen every month and are a chance to talk to
acedb developers and to other users. Dan Lawson suggested that it would be
good if we could have some short overviews in these meetings of various
parts of acedb. He has volunteered to start with an overview of
"super link" and "link" objects as used in the worm database in Junes
user group meeting. If you would like to contribute an overview or would like
to see some topic covered then send suggestions to
<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.
