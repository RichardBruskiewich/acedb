<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - June 2000</H1>

<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<P>This month saw the first Acedb Workshop since 1997, which took place in Vancouver. Thanks
go to Richard Bruskiewich and Steve Jones (a former Sanger person,
who now works at the Genome Sequence
Centre, Vancouver) for their efforts in organising the workshop.
This issue will be about the conference and what happened there.


<a name="General"></a><H2>General News</H2>

<a name="Apologies"></a><h3>Apologies</h3>

<P>Apologies for no Acedb Users meeting this month, in the end there just was
not time to organise one.

<P>There will be a meeting in July, if you have issues you want to raise before
then, please come and see the acedb developers in our new room (D2-12) which is
just down from reception, near personnel/accounts etc.

<a name="newsletter"></a><h3>The Newsletter</h3>

<P>Partly as a result of requests at the
conference and partly because of independent requests from acedb users at other
sites, this newsletter is now being added to the acedb newsgroup each month and
is also being sent out to users at other sites. I hope to solicit some useful
articles from contacts made at the conference.


<a name="Acedb2000"></a><H2>Acedb2000 at Vancouver</H2>

<P>I'm not going to cover everything that happened at Vancouver, the
following sections deal with subjects most relevant to the Sanger Centre.
A fuller description of the conference will appear on the acedb web site
in due course.

<a name="Grid"></a><h3>Grid</h3>

<P>Gudmund Thorission from Iceland gave a short presentation on how he
hopes to use the grid models/display for micro-array data. The main
points for discussion were:

<ul>
  <li><b>scale -</b> can acedb hold the amount of data that micro-arrays
      would produce.
  <li><b>colours -</b> is it possible to colour code the squares in the
      grid display so that they look meaningful to the user.
  <li><b>intelligent display -</b> can the grid display be made to work to
      allow reasonable scrolling across a micro-array but not need to load in
      the data for the entire array at once (as this may require prohibitive
      amounts of memory).
</ul>

<P>This conversation mirrors several that have happened in the Sanger Centre
over at least the last year (e.g. with Dan Lawson and Adam Butler). What's
required now is an initial specification which includes:

<ul>
  <li>expected size of micro-arrays
  <li>amount of data per micro-array element
  <li>some typical colour schemes
</ul>

Adam Butler is going to take an initial stab at this, but if you are interested in
seeing this done then don't sit back, either start a discussion on the acedb newsgroup
or email the acedb developers direct (<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>).

<a name="Zacedb"></a><h3>Zacedb</h3>

<P>Richard Durbin spent much of his time at Vancouver working on a new 
storage layer for acedb. This is the part of acedb that stores/retrieves
objects to/from disk. The idea here would to allow a choice of
"backends", perhaps including free (e.g. mySQL, BerkeleyDB, the original acedb system)
or commercial (e.g. Oracle, Sysbase) systems to be used. The backend would not
"know" about acedb objects, it would only be used to store/retrieve them and
provide other services such as locking.

<P>The rationale for doing this is that the backend system could be used to allow truly
concurrent reading/writing via threading and more reliability via support for transactions.
This would be a great advance for acedb and would supply features requested by
Sanger and external users.

<P>This work is currently only at the <I>"broken prototype"</I> stage, much work needs
to be done on further prototyping, in particular to assess whether performance
would be good enough with a different backend.

<a name="website"></a><h3>The acedb web site</h3>

<P>The session on the format/usability of the acedb web site produced one
main conclusion: <b>it's not very user friendly</b>. Fortunately there
were also a lot of suggestions for improvements including:

<ul>
  <li>completely revamping the downloads section
  <li>less developer, more user stuff
  <li>provide search facilities for acedb keywords
  <li>sort the documentation out !
</ul>

<P>and a host of other good suggestions.

<P>We plan to substantially reorganise the web site over the next few weeks.

<a name="socket"></a><h3>socket server</h3>

<P>There were a number of talks/tutorials on how to use/set up
the new sockets-based version of the acedb server/client (available now
in Acedb 4_8c in ~acedb/RELEASE.DEVELOPMENT/bin.XXX directories).
If you would like more information or a tutorial on the new
server/client system (how to set up user passwords etc.) then contact
Ed Griffiths (<A HREF="mailto:edgrif@sanger.ac.uk">edgrif@sanger.ac.uk</A>).

<P>Other important developments related to the socket server included:

<ul>
  <li><b>AcePerl -</b> Lincoln Stein has produced a new version of AcePerl that now talks
      directly to the socket server, you can get more information on this
      from: <A href="http://stein.cshl.org/AcePerl/">http://stein.cshl.org/AcePerl/</A>.
      Note that because AcePerl can now talk directly to the server you will
      be able to use AcePerl from Windows and Apple Macs because AcePerl is now purely in
      Perl with no C code compilation required.
  <li><b>AcePython -</b> <A HREF="mailto:uiy6@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de">Sean Powell</A>
      & <A HREF="mailto:uhpk@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de">Siegfried Schloissnig</A> wrote a python
      interface to the socket server whilst at the conference. If you want access to this
      code send a note to Ed Griffiths (<A HREF="mailto:edgrif@sanger.ac.uk">edgrif@sanger.ac.uk</A>).
</ul>

<P>Note that you can also interface to the socket server from Java:
(<A href="http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/">http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/</A>.


<a name="SMAP"></a><h3>SMAP - a new way to construct sequences</h3>

<P>There has been a lot of discussion at Sanger over how to construct
larger sequences up to whole chromosome level. There was a whole session
devoted to this with an introductory talk by Richard Bruskiewich, followed
by a talk by Richard Durbin which gave an overview of the proposed model
for SMAP and a model for exons.

<P>A fair summary would probably be that the SMAP model should solve a lot
of the problems that were experienced with chromosome 22 and with large sequence
construction in general. The difficult bit of the code still needs writing but
that should happen over the next few weeks.

<P>What to do about building haplotype sequences remains unsolved however.

<a name="AQL"></a><h3>AQL</h3>

<P>There was a lot of interest in AQL as a more powerful replacement for
the Query language and TableMaker. We would welcome more reports about
how people find AQL to use, any performance problems etc.

<P>A major requirement for AQL is some kind of query builder and also
more tutorial documentation of the "how to..." type. Anyone fancy writing
an article on how to use AQL ??



<a name="Acedbmac"></a><h3>Acedb and the Mac</h3>

<P>There were a significant number of users who would like to see
a more up to date copy of acedb available on the Mac. Simon Kelley has
made some headway with obtaining a software environment in which to build
acedb on the Mac. The basic problem here is that we do not have the resources
to maintain code that requires a completely different build environment, graphics
routines etc.

<P>Things look hopeful but no more than that.
