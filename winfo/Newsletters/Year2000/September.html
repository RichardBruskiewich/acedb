<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - September 2000</H1>

<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<a name="Apologies"></a><H3>Apologies</H3>

<P>There have been no newsletters for too long, sorry, sorry, sorry. We have
had a number of problems with the build/test system for acedb which have
precluded the usual monthly releases of development code. This has
ended up with me delaying sending out the newsletters because there seemed
little point when they refer to new features/bug fixes in code that is not yet
available.

<a name="General"></a><H2>General News</H2>

<p><b>Xref bug believed fixed...</b> a long standing bug in xref which resulted in
"object locked" errors when trying to update databases with objects containing particular
types of xrefs has now been fixed (see bugs section).

<P>Most news this month is about bug fixes as we get ready for the next significant release
which will be called Acedb 4_9.


<a name="New"></a><H2>New Features</H2>

<a name="tacecommand"></a><H3>tace command sets</H3>

<p>If you issue the <code>"?"</code> command from within tace you get to see
a list of the commands that you can issue. Previously in tace (and aceclient) this list was
misleading because it included commands that the user would not be able to
run because they did not have write access to the database. This has
now been fixed so that if a user does not have write access they will not see
commands that require write access.


<a name="Bugs"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="tacebug"></a><H3>tace bug</H3>

<p>When tace is run via a pipe (e.g. from a perl or shell script) it saves
the database on quitting by default. This behaviour was broken in 4_8 and has
now been restored. This is particularly important because running tace via
scripts is one of the main mechanisms used at Sanger for doing large scale
updates to databases.

<a name="Expanding"></a><H3>Expanding database</H3>

<p>There was a problem in 4_8 with databases growing enormously when a large
number of separate updates were made to the database. This has been fixed
and was caused by old sessions (a session is a record of the state of the database
after a set up updates has been made) not being deleted correctly from the database.

<P>To see the benefit from this fix you will need to rebuild the database.


<a name="CDSstartend"></a><H3>CDS start/end positions</H3>

<P>Perhaps not a bug, more a confusion in meaning. For a sequence object that is a CDS
you can specify the start/end positions of the CDS within the accompanying Source_exons
and here in lies the problem. The start/end positions must be specified in spliced DNA
coordinates, <b>not</b> in Source_exon coordinates. This means you have to do some mental
arithmetic if you are inserting the CDS positions by hand: you will need to add up the length of the
Source_exon sections to get the size of the spliced DNA and work out where the CDS
starts and ends within the single continuous section of exon DNA.

<P>acedb will now output an error message if a CDS is displayed where the start/end positions
lie outside of the spliced DNA and will display the CDS as if it occupied the entire length
of the spliced DNA.


<a name="CDSreverse"></a><H3>CDS start/end positions not working for reverse genes</H3>

<P>There was an annoying bug whereby, for reverese genes only, acedb would ignore a CDS start position
unless an end position was specified as well. This has been fixed so that a CDS for a reverse
gene now behaves the same way as for forward genes.


<a name="Obscure"></a><H3>Obscure socket server bug</H3>

<p>When started by inetd, the socket server crashed inetd on some linux systems
because it wrongly <b>"shutdown"</b> the listening socket when exitting. This has
been fixed.


<a name="XREF"></a><H3>XREF problem</H3>

<p>There has been a bug in the XREF code when making updates to a database for a long time.
In 4_8 this has manifested itself in the form of updates failing where they involve XREFs
with UNIQUE tags. This seems now to be fixed at long last, if this is not so then please send
reports to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<P>This is an important bug to fix because it has been the principal reason for not releasing
updates to large databases as "diffs". Currently databases such as the Worm database have
to be released as complete new copies every time there is an update. Now the Xref bug is fixed it
should be possible to release an update file which consists only of those parts of the database
are different since the previous relase.


<H2>No monthly build available.</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, due to system problems at the Sanger Centre a monthly build has
not been possible for September.

<H2>Next User Group Meeting - D213, 2.30pm, Thursday, 14th September</H2>
