<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - August 2000</H1>

<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<P>This month sees some changes to output from the (p)parse commands
to give more accurate and informative results about the parsing of acedb data.
There is also a small but important change to acedb logging data
to allow easier analysis of database activity. And there's a tip about what
to do when acedb runs out of memory.


<a name="General"></a><H2>General News</H2>

<a name="Acedb"></a><H4>Acedb and running out of memory</H4>

<p>Most people who have used acedb for some time will have seen a message like this:

<pre><code>
"Memory allocation failure, when requesting 100000 bytes, 20034340 already allocated"
</code></pre>

<P>If you were using <code>xace</code> all you can do is click the "OK" button and then
xace terminates.

<p>Acedb can run out of memory for a number of reasons:
<ul>
  <li>The machine is being heavily used and has run out of memory.
  <li>There is an error in the code and it is asking for some huge amount of memory.
  <li>The object you are trying to load from the database is just too large to
      be viewed on this machine.
  <li>Your personal "process datasize limit" is set too low.
</ul>

<p>If you are using acedb and memory allocation fails when trying to allocate some fairly
small amount of memory e.g. perhaps 5MB ( about 5,000,000 bytes), then there is a good
chance that its because of the last reason mentioned in the list above. In this case
you will probably be able to do something about it straight away.

<P>To check this you should do the
following (assuming you use C shell which is what most people at Sanger use):

<P><b>1)</b> Add up the total number of bytes that acedb needed when it crashed:
<pre><code>
"Memory allocation failure, when requesting 5242880 bytes, 125829120 already allocated"
</code></pre>
<P>In this case a total of 125829120 + 5242880 = 131072000 bytes (or about 125 MB)

<P><b>2)</b> Find out what your current limit is:
<pre><code>
griffin[edgrif]65: limit datasize
datasize        131072 kbytes
</code></pre>
<P>In this case the limit is 128MB, although this is more than the 125MB acedb needs,
acedb makes use of other libraries which use up memory so this is close enough to
suspect that the datasize limit is the problem.

<P><b>3)</b> Find out if you can increase you current limit:
<pre><code>
griffin[edgrif]66: limit -h datasize
datasize        1048576 kbytes
</code></pre>
<P>Here the upper limit is set to 1024MB so there is plenty of
scope to increase the datasize limit.

<P><b>4)</b> Increase the limit and rerun acedb:
<pre><code>
griffin[edgrif]66: limit datasize 524288
</code></pre>
<P>This sets the datasize to 512MB, the limit can be increased further
as required.


<a name="New"></a><H2>New Features</H2>

<a name="Change"></a><H4>Change to output from (p)parse command</H4>

<P>The output from the parse and pparse commands has been changed
to give more complete information about the ace data parsed. Previously
no reporting was done for array objects parsed (e.g. raw DNA data) or
for attempts to delete objects. In addition not all errors were trapped
or reported.

<p>The new output has these main changes:
<ul>
  <li>the following information is shown for each error found:
      <ul>
	<li>the type of object being processed
	<li>the first line of the object being processed, which shows its type.
	<li>the reason why parsing of the object failed is more reliably reported.
      </ul>
  <li>the summary now includes counts of <b>all</b> objects found and shows the numbers
      that failed or were parsed correctly.
  <li>a larger summary can be requested that shows stats for array and normal objects separately
      and also records error stats where the type of the object could not be determined.
</ul>

<P>Originally the commands produced:

<pre><code>
acedb&gt; pparse some_file.ace
// Parsing file  some_file.ace
// Parse error near line 5 in eds_grid1 : Unknown tag "FunnyLine1"
// Parse error near line 57 in eds_grid1.2 : Unknown tag "FunnyLine2"
// Parse error near line 163 in eds_grid1.9 : Unknown tag "FunnyLine3"
// 18 objects read with 3 errors
// 15 Active Objects
acedb&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>The commands now produce:
<pre><code>
acedb&gt; pparse some_file.ace
// Parsing file some_file.ace
// ERROR: parse error (object) near line 5 in "grid : "eds_grid1"", error was: Unknown tag "FunnyLine1"
// ERROR: parse error (object) near line 57 in "grid : "eds_grid1.2"", error was: Unknown tag "FunnyLine2"
// ERROR: parse error (object) near line 163 in "grid : "eds_grid1.9"", error was: Unknown tag "FunnyLine3"
// <b>objects processed: 18 found, 15 parsed ok, 3 parse failed</b>
// 15 Active Objects
acedb&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Individual errors are now reported like this:

<pre><code>
// ERROR: parse error (<b>object</b>) near line 5 in <b>"grid : "eds_grid1""</b>, error was: <b>Unknown tag "FunnyLine1"</b>
</code></pre>

<P>so you get to know the type of thing being parsed ("general", "object" or "array", 
where general means "can't ascertain the type"). You see the first line of the
object/paragraph which should contain the type and name of the object. You also
get to see the original error message which describes what was wrong with the
object.

<P>At the end of parsing you now see a summary:

<pre><code>
// objects processed: 18 found, 15 parsed ok, 3 parse failed
</code></pre>

<p>where it should be true that: found = ok + failed.

<p>If you specify "-v" for parse or pparse you see more detail:

<pre><code>
// total processed: 18 found, 15 parsed ok, 3 parse failed
//         general: 0 errors
//         objects: 15 added, 0 editted, 0 deleted, 0 renamed, 0 aliased, 3 errors
//          arrays: 0 added, 0 empty, 0 deleted, 0 errors
</code></pre>

<p>So you get to see general errors, e.g. no class name specified for a delete
operation, ordinary object operations and array object operations, normal object
stats and array object stats separately.



<a name="logformat"></a><H4>Change to <code>log.wrm</code> format</H4>

<P><code>log.wrm</code> is the file where acedb programs write information
about who is using the database, what they are using the database for
and also information about any serious errors.

<P>Currently the first log record for a user starting a new session on a
database looks like this:
<pre>
New start User:edgrif,  ACEDB 4_8b,  compiled on: Oct  5 1999 14:43:15
</pre>

<P>whereas the standard record format for all other log messages is:
<pre>
2000-04-03_17:21:09 griffin 20611	***some action***
</pre>

<P>This is not ideal for serveral reasons:
<ul>
  <li>having a different first record needlessly complicates parsing of the log file.
  <li>there is no easy to tie the new session record
      for a user with the subsequent records for that user.
  <li>there is no time record for when the user started.
  <li>there is no record of which acedb program the user was running.
</ul>

<P>To address these issues the first record for a new user session has been changed
so that:

<P><b>All log records now have the standard prefix:</b>
<pre><code>
     "date_time network_id PID"

e.g. "2000-04-03_17:21:09 griffin 20611"
</code></pre>

<P><b>The new user session record format is:</b>
<pre><code>
     "date_time network_id PID  NEW_START: User:userid, Program:progname, Level:ace_level, compiled on: date time"

e.g. "2000-07-20_14:20:37 griffin 19877    NEW_START: User:edgrif, Program:tace, Level:ACEDB 4_8c, compiled on: Jul 20 2000 14:14:21
</code></pre>

<P>This means all logs records will now have the same prefix and that the user can
now be tied to their log records via the PID/network_id,
the time of their first use of the database will be
recorded and also which program and which machine they were using.


<a name="Bugs"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="Protein"></a><H4>Protein Translation Bugs in fmap</H4>

<p><b>Protein translation displayed in fmap window:</b> display of protein translations
for <code>CDS</code>'s in the fmap window did not
work correctly for reverse strand genes. If you set the beginning position
for translation by altering:

<pre>
<code>
Properties -&gt; Coding -&gt; CDS  &lt;new start position&gt;
</code>
</pre>

then the protein translation did not get updated to reflect the change.
If you set the end position as well then the translation was shown correctly.
This is now fixed so the correct translation is always shown.

<p><b>Protein translation displayed in separate protein window:</b> Several users
have noticed that when they set the end position in the <code>CDS</code> (as mentioned above),
they get huge numbers of the character 'X' appended to the end of the translation.
This is because the <code>CDS</code> positions <b>must</b> be specified in the spliced DNA coordinates,
<b>not</b> the <code>Source_Exons</code> coordinates. If you use the latter then you will be specifying
an end position well past the end of the spliced DNA, thus causing the code to append the
'X's to "fill in" the missing data.

<P>Code will be added to give a warning that the specified positions are outside of the
spliced DNA coordinate range.


<a name="treewindow"></a><H4>Incompletely drawn tree display window when updating</H4>

<P>Many users have noticed how sometimes when they try to "Update" the tree display
(i.e. the class viewer window), the window is sometimes only partly drawn with the
lower part of the window being blank until the window is scrolled up and down. This
very irritating bug has finally be pinned down to an error, not in acedb, but in the
underlying GTK toolkit. A work around is in place until the new fixed versions of GTK
filter through.


<H2>August monthly build NOT yet available.</H2>

<P>Currently the acedb test system is not working correctly so only half of the code has
been tested. This should be fixed this week. You will receive email when testing has
been completed.

<P>Note that this means that some of the features mentioned above will not be available
until testing has been completed.
