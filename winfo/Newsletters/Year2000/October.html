<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - October 2000</H1>

<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<P>Like last month, this month has been a month of bug fixes in preparation
for the release of Acedb 4_9.


<a name="New"></a><H2>New Features</H2>


<a name="AcedbCD"></a><H3>Acedb MS-Windows CD packaging improvements</H3>

<p>The following improvements have been made to the <code>Install</code>
process:
<ul>
  <li>- there's a new database wizard in the for the installation, it will
      install the acedb binaries and set up a new/empty default database.
  <li>- the file extension ".wrm" is automatically registered with MS-Windows
      to be opened with MS-Windows Notepad as this is a suitable editor
      for altering them.
  <li>- The latest Worm WS releases are now regularly packaged with the Acedb
      MS-Windows CD.
</ul>

<p><b>Coming soon -</b> at the <A HREF="http://www.acedb.org/">Acedb web site</A>,
a document on how to make windows packages, databases, cds,
for acedb.

<a name="URLs"></a><H3>URLs on Acedb MS-Windows</H3>

<p>URLs in objects now work correctly in the MS-Windows version of acedb, the URL will
be displayed by whichever program is registered with MS-Windows to deal with URLs (this
might be Internet Explorer or maybe Netscape).

<a name="wrmfilesMS"></a><H3>".wrm" files on Acedb MS-Windows</H3>

<p>A problem with Unix vs. MS-Windows is that they signal the end of a line
of text in a different way. This matters if you edit one of acedbs text files
(e.g. models.wrm) on Windows and then try to edit again on a Unix machine.
Acedb expects ".wrm" text files to use the Unix way of representing an end-of-line,
but the MS-Windows version will also cope with the MS-Windows way of doing this.
This means that Acedb will continue to work if you have editted your models.wrm
file on an MS-Windows machine.


<a name="Bugs"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="percentbug"></a><H3>"%" Dumping bug</H3>

<P>acedb 4_8 had a bug whereby <code>"%"</code> signs within data in the database
e.g. "GC content 48%" would not be dumped correctly because the <code>"%"</code>
was read as a formatting instruction. This is now fixed.

<a name="Incorrect"></a><H3>Incorrect ordering of output to screen under tace</H3>

<P>Error messages in tace could get tangled with the <code>"acedb>"</code> prompt
which was confusing. This has now been fixed. 


<a name="Loss"></a><H3>Loss of window focus</H3>

<p>Sometimes when acedb popped up messages (warnings, information etc.), this could
lead to the acedb losing the keyboard focus, i.e. any typing by the user would be
lost. This is now fixed.


<H2>No monthly build available.</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, due to system problems at the Sanger Centre a monthly build has
not been possible for September.

<H2>Next User Group Meeting - D213, 2.30pm, Thursday, 12th October</H2>
