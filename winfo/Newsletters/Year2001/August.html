<a name="ftp_warning"></a><H3>WARNING about for ULCC ftp users.</H3>

<P>The Sanger Centre has had to tighten up security in recent months and
this has prompted some changes to ftp protocols. This change has affected
a number of users who regularly ftp to Sanger, ULCC users will now be
affected by these changes.
The following mail from one of our Systems Support staff says it all:

<pre>&gt; We have just noticed that all the virtual hosts on the remote FTP server
&gt; at ULCC allow connections from remote hosts without a reverse DNS entry.
&gt; For security reasons this is not ideal and should be enabled. Currently
&gt; the following virtual hosts are hosted by our remote FTP server:
&gt;
&gt;       ftp.sanger.ac.uk
&gt;       ftp.ensembl.org
&gt;       ftp.ebi.ac.uk
&gt;
&gt; We propose that we enable reverse DNS entry checks as soon as possible.
&gt; Therefore, we will change the FTP access configuration file for Sanger and
&gt; Ensembl (not EBI) at midday tomorrow (Thursday 13th). This will obviously
&gt; effect a few of our collaborators and possible lead to a few days/weeks
&gt; worth of email complaints. Sorry, for this we apologies.
&gt;
&gt; When a host does not have a valid reverse DNS entry the following error
&gt; message will be displayed:
&gt;
&gt; -- start --
&gt;       Your host does not have a reverse DNS entry.
&gt;
&gt;       Connections are not permitted unless there is a valid reverse DNS.
&gt;
&gt;       Please contact your network administrator to resolve this problem.
&gt; -- end --
</pre>

<P>If you work at ULCC or have queries about the changes to ftp at Sanger please
could you contact Systems Support direct by sending mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:ssg@sanger.ac.uk">ssg@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<a name="New_Features"></a><H2>New Features</H2>

<a name="tsuser_option"></a><H3>New "-tsuser" command line option for tace.</H3>

<P>A common practice in the Sanger Centre is to update the main databases
via overnight queues of cron jobs which in essence use <b>tace</b> to
parse in the database modifications. One problem with this is that all
the jobs tend to be run using the same userid, so all changes by all jobs
will be labelled with that same userid. This makes it difficult to establish
exactly which job caused which changes.

<P>A new command line option to tace allows the changes to be registered
using an alternative label to that of the current userid. This means
that each cron job could be given its own label so that changes made
by that cron job can be identified.

<P>Use tace like this:
<pre><code>tace -tsuser new_label /your/database</code>
</pre>

<P>You can also use this option on the command line for xace as well.


<a name="efetch_homol"></a><H3>New fmap option to efetch homols.</H3>

<P>The right button menu that appears when you click on a dna or peptide homology
now includes an option to efetch the sequence for that homology.

<a name="core_dumps"></a><H3>Xace, "core" dumps and Signal Catching.</H3>

<P>Sometimes (hard to believe I know), acedb crashes because of some fundamental
error either in the code (or even in the hardware) that is detected by the operating
system. When this happens the operating system
does two things: it sends the program a special "signal" that the error has happened, the
program can ignore this or perhaps do some cleaning up before exitting, if the program
takes no action then the operating
system will then try to take a copy of the program in memory from which its possible to see what the
program was doing when it crashed. The copy is held in the familiar "core" file.

<P>By default acedb intercepts the "signal" from the operating system so it can
close the database properly before asking the operating system to make a core file.
The core file produced by this is often useless for debugging however
as its initial entries are about the section of code to close the database, and
it can be impossible to get back from there to the original point of failure.

<P>More useful is to turn off this signal catching by acedb so that the operating
system will produce a core file that contains exactly the point of failure,
To do this you need to:
<ol>
  <li>Make sure that you do not have write access to the database, or work
      with a copy of your database !
  <li>Set your user limit for core dumps to "unlimited" by typing
      "unlimit core" (this is for csh, other shells will have the equivalent
      command).
  <li>Either start xace specifying the "-nosigcatch" commandline option, or
      turn signal catching off from the "Admin.." menu.
  <li>Then reproduce the bug and give the resultant core file to us (note the
      file may be very large so don't send it as mail but simply tell us where
      we can access it !!).
  <li>We will also need the copy of xace that you used.
</ol>



<a name="AQL_change"></a><H3>A change to the way AQL searches for locators</H3>

<P>An attempted optimisation in AQL introduced a bug which has now been fixed.

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of John Sturdy</I>
<A HREF="mailto:jcgs@sanger.ac.uk">jcgs@sanger.ac.uk</A>)

<P>Consider the following fragment of aql:

<pre><code><b>select paper, author1, institute1, author2, institute2
  from paper in class Paper,
       author1 in paper->Author,
       institute1 in author1->Institute,
       author2 in paper->Author,
       institute2 in author2->Institute
  where (institute1 = "MRC-LMB") and (institute2 = "CNRS")
</b></code></pre>

<P>AQL used to use a spurious attempt at optimisation which, in this example,
resulted in institute1 being substituted for institute2, which resulted in
no objects matching the query (since institute1 could not be equal to two
different things simultaneously). This bug is now fixed.

<P>In some cases, this change may cause unwanted large
cross products. If this is a problem please send bug reports to
<A HREF="mailto:jcgs@sanger.ac.uk">jcgs@sanger.ac.uk</A>.

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="graphUpdate"></a><H3>Bug in graphUpdateEditors()</H3>

<P>This function is hardly ever used, which is good because it
could not have worked correctly: it handled neither toggle or colour editors,
but instead called graphTextScrollEntry() on them both producing garbage in whatever window
they were displayed in. The function now correctly updates the state of the displayed
editor boxes.


<a name="message_window"></a><H3>Multiline messages in Message window.</H3>

<P>The message window did not handle multiline messages correctly.
Multiline messages are now displayed on a single line with a &lt;TAB&gt;
added in place of each newline character. This leaves the messages
as readable and avoids the window becoming full with large multiline
messages.


<a name="sigcatch_menu"></a><H3>Signal Catching menu/window item.</H3>

<P>The "Signal Catching" item (from the "Admin.." button on the main window)
got out of synch with the actual state of signal catching in xace. This is now
fixed.



<a name="WWWdisplay"></a><H3>WWWdisplay() function</H3>

<P>bug fixes to WWWdisplay() and addition to look for Web_location in
the class Class object if not found in the object itself


<a name="peptide_translation"></a><H3>Peptide translation</H3>

<P>Several small bugs were fixed in peptide translation:
<ul>
  <li>The stop codon was translated for some functions, the stop
      codon is not now included for any translation.
  <li>Translation was proceeding too far for the case where the end
      of the CDS is not included in the current set of exons. Translation
      is now up to and including the last complete codon for a CDS with
      the End_not_found tag set.
  <li>an unnoticeable bug (except in usage of memory): the array to hold
      the translation was almost 3x bigger than it needed to be because
      of missing brackets around the maths to calculate the array size.
</ul>



<a name="checkSequenceLength"></a><H3>checkSequenceLength() failed for simple
DNA only objects.</H3>

<P>Last months xace did not display simple dna objects in an fmap because
of a trivial error in the checkSequenceLength() function which detects when
users ask to view very big sequences and gives them the chance to cancel
the fmap display.

<a name="blixem_toolbar"></a><H3>Blixem Toolbar bug</H3>

<P>Recent changes to Blixem included a removable toolbar, this introduced a
but whereby the window could not be collapsed when the toolbar was "docked",
this has now been fixed.
