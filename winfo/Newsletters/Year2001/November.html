<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>
<P>The arrival and then disappearance again of some smap code, no more unexpected changes
in the accuracy of float data, more control of file parsing in xace, an
important bug fix for the Url class in AceDB.

<a name="new_dna"></a><H3>Introduction and then removal of smap-based dna retrieval</H3>

<P>Or to put it another way...an apology.

<P>I tested some new code which used Smap functions (more of this in the January issue)
to retrieve the dna for sequences in fmap. I compared the old and new code by dumping the dna
for the whole of Chromosome 22 in Human and found that it worked correctly. I put the new
code in the November monthly release, only to find that the code did not work properly when
the sequence object selected contained exons specified via the Source_exons tag. Sadly this
has resulted in a number of bugs in other parts of the code not obviously related to this
problem.

<P>Accordingly the change was removed until we could be sure it was working correctly.
Sorry, sorry, sorry to all of you who used the November code and found it to be not working
at all well. A fix is being worked on now.


<a name="float_rounding"></a><H3>Judicious rounding of floats to ensure constant accuracy
across platforms</H3>

<P>Accuracy in floating point numbers across different platforms can be very different. The
IEEE floating point standards do guarantee a minimum of 6 significant figures of accuracy.
AceDB now rounds all floating point numbers to this accuracy on output/input from ace files
to ensure that floating point numbers <B>stay the same</b> in a database regardless of
the machine being used to interact with the database.

<P>This is important otherwise floating numbers can appear to have changed just because
a different machine is used to read in or output them. This causes a problem because
objects that have floating point numbers with many significant figures (e.g. x = 1/3)
look as though they have changed because they can be specified more exactly in an
ace file than in the machine which must round them to its maximum available accuracy.

<P>You should be aware that AceDB will now hold floating point numbers to a maximum
of 6 significant figures.


<a name="parse_files"></a><H3>Ignoring errors while parsing files in xace</H3>

<P>tace has the command "pparse" to allow you to parse a file and ignore any
errors on the way, xace would always stop however at the first error. Now an
extra button has been added to the parse dialog window to allow you to select
to ignore errors and keep parsing the file. This can be very useful if you
just want to see how many errors there are in a trial parse of a file. The
errors get reported at the end so you do get to see them.

<P>This also resulting in the fixing of a bug that meant that if the input file
was a series of "-R", "-D" or "-A"
lines without blank lines in between, then the parser skipped to the end
of the file even if it was supposed to be allowing for errors.

<a name="netscape_openurl"></a><H3>Bug in Netscapes "OpenURL" command
breaks AceDB's Url class</H3>

<P>A bug in Netscapes "OpenURL" command caused AceDB WWW links to fail if
the link contained a ",". This is often the case for links that are cgi programs
as a comma is often used to separate the arguments to the cgi program.
AceDB uses the netscape "OpenURL" remote command to display links, but the 
syntax for this command is: "OpenURL (URL [, new-window])" and unfortunately
netscape assumes that any "," contained in the url
is actually the "," for its OpenURL command and reports a syntax error !

<p>Having found the
cause of the problem we were able to call on Roger Pettet of the Sanger Centre
web team to
provide a solution. AceDB now scans the url from the database for any commas
and replaces them with "%2C", which is the standard URL code for a comma. Netscape
will then honour the request via its OpenURL command to display the link. Users
will unfortunately see this translation in the link displayed in the text box
at the top of Netscape but this is unavoidable which looks a bit ugly but at
least the Url's work reliably.



<a name="blixem_external"></a><H3>Some more points about running an external Blixem</H3>

<P>Last months newsletter talked about how to run
blixem externally
but unfortunately missed out a couple of important points.

<h4>What you need to do to your database to use the external blixem</h4>

<P>Firstly, you <b>must</b> use versions of xace and blixem from the same
release of acedb, this is because xace passes information to blixem via command
line parameters and these have changed as more function has been added. If you
use an old blixem with a new xace, or vice versa, you may get unexplained crashes.

<P>When you tell xace to use an external version of blixem, it actually
calls a script in the <code><b>wscripts</b></code> subdirectory of your
database. The script is called blixem_standalone and you can download
it from the acedb downloads page. If you edit the script you will see
it looks like this:

<pre>#!/bin/csh
# This script is called by xace to launch a standalone
# version of blixem. You should replace the below
# path with wherever you keep the acedb code.
#

~/acedb/CODE/acedb/bin.ALPHA_4/blixem $*


exit 0
</pre>

<P>You should edit the blixem line so that it contains the path to where you
have downloaded your copy of the latest blixem.

<h4>Temporary files clutter</h4>

<P>Some of the information passed from xace to blixem is passed via temporary
files, these files are stored in a directory called
<code><b>/tmp/your_userid_ACEDB_BLIXEM</b></code> on your machine. The xace and blixem
code has been written so that it will remove these files if the programs terminate normally
and also in most cases if the programs crash for some reason.
You should be aware however that there are some circumstances in which the files will not
be removed and you should periodically look in this directory and remove old files.

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="test_overflow"></a><H3>Main window "text overflow"</H3>

<P>An old chestnut, it was possible to overflow the text query box on the
old style main window because its length was given wrongly compared to the size
of buffer underlying it. The usual bug of not counting properly the terminating
NULL char.


<a name="cds_display"></a><H3>Bug in CDS display</H3>

<P>The cds display for exons had a bug so that if the sequence was complemented
or reversed or either followed by an fmap recalculate, the cds position in the
exons was no longer displayed correctly. This has now been fixed.


<a name="blixem_bug_external"></a><H3>Bug in call to external blixem</H3>

<P>AceDB was not passing across to an externally called blixem any sequences already
contained in the database.
Instead blixem would have to call efetch or pfetch which might not find
the sequence. This has now been fixed and AceDB will pass over all sequences
that it contains for blixem to display.

<a name="Developers_Corner"></a><H2>Developers Corner</H2>

<a name="aceTmpRemove"></a><H3>New aceTmp call</H3>

<P>Originally the aceTmp package always removed temporary files when the aceTmp
object was destroyed. A new call, aceTmpNoRemove(), allows the programmer to
control dynamically whether this happens or not. There are occasions when
the files need to be left where they are, see the
<A href="#blixem_external">blixem article</A> above.


<a name="implicit_decs"></a><H3>Those damned implicit declarations</H3>

<P>Probably every developer does it at one time or another, its late and
you just can't be bothered to put in the include for that system header
that declares the function you've just used and anyway its only a compiler
warning.

<P>Simon fixed one in freesubs for strtod() and strtol() by including
stdlib.h. Perhaps I'll let him have the last word, his CVS entry for
this bug which broke AceDB compilation on the Mac was:

<pre><code>declare strtod and strtol by including stdlib.h
Those "implicit declaration" warnings should be read as "one day, this
_will_ break". In this case on porting to MACOS_X
</code></pre>


<a name="utils_int"></a><H3>New "string to integer" conversion routines</H3>

<P>There are a couple of new routines in the libfree.a library which convert
strings to "int" or "long int" more reliably than the standard C library
routines. For instance, did you know that strtol() will convert "123rubbish"
into the "long int" 123 <b>and</b> you won't be able to detect that the entire
word was not converted ?

<P>Now you can use utStr2Int() and utStr2LongInt() to convert strings reliably
to "int" or "long int", the functions return TRUE if the conversion was successful
and FALSE if it failed including for the case mentioned above.


<a name="string_prefs"></a><H3>User preferences now include strings</H3>

<P>The user preferences code has been extended to allow the specifying of
preferences that are strings, an example would be the machine id for specifying
where the pfetch server is for sequence fetches.
