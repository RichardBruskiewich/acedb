<H1>ACEDB User Group Newsletter - January 2001</H1>



<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P>If you want to have this newsletter mailed to you <B>or</B> you want to
make comments/suggestions about the format/content then
send an email to <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>.



<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P>This is the post-Christmas/not that much has changed report. There
are small but important changes to the acedb database log format, a short
article about the introduction of better web-based downloads for acedb and
a number of bug fixes.


<!--******************************************************************** -->
<a name="General"></a><h2>General News</H2>

<a name="File"></a><h3>File Chooser and selecting a directory</H3>

<p>A number of users didn't see last months newsletter and wanted to know how
to go directly to a directory using the 4_8c file chooser. 
I'll just repeat last months item about how to do this:
<ul>
  <li>If you want to go directly to a directory using the file chooser
      window, you can do this by
      typing the directory name in the bottom "selection" window
      and pressing the &lt;tab&gt; key. This will point the file chooser
      to this directory so you can then choose files from there.
  <li><b>Note</b> that the &lt;tab&gt; key also does C-shell style filename completion
      just like you get when using an xterm window. So if you type part of
      a directory and press &lt;tab&gt; the rest will be filled in for
      you (as far as this can be done unambiguously).
</ul>

<P>Hope that's useful.



<!--******************************************************************** -->
<a name="New"></a><h2>New Features</H2>

<a name="Acedb"></a><h3>Acedb on windows</H3>

<P>The acedb locking/write access mechanism now works on Windows 95/98.


<a name="Better"></a><h3>Better information for signals</H3>

<P>When an internal error happens in acedb or the system runs out of resources
(e.g. program stack space), the operating system may send a "signal" to acedb
which stops the program from running. When this happens acedb runs a special
signal handling routine which attempts to terminate the acedb program with
a message about what has happened.

<P>The message that acedb outputs has been improved in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>The message now includes an operating system defined message that
      identifies the cause of the signal.
  <li>The text of the message has been changed so more accurately indicate
      whether the signal is likely to have been caused by an acedb error
      or by a system resource error.
</ul>

<P>So if one of the acedb programs you are using exits with a message like this:

<pre><code>
// ABORT : Fatal error, program received signal....
</code></pre>

and you can remember/reproduce the sequence of actions that caused it then please
get in touch with the acedb developers
(<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A>).


<a name="Preserve"></a><h3>"Preserve" behaviour restored</H3>

<P>Due to popular demand, the "preserve" button has been added back for the
tree window display, selecting this item on a tree window menu will ensure
that the window stays around until explicitly "quit".



<!--******************************************************************** -->
<a name="Articles"></a><h2>Articles</H2>


<a name="Rearrangements"></a><h3>Rearrangements to acedb downloads</code></H3>

<P>Its possible to download acedb code in one of two ways:

<dl>
  <dt><b>FTP site</b>
  <dd>login to the sanger ftp site and go to /pub/acedb
  <dt><b>Web site</b>
  <dd>visit <A href="http://www.acedb.org/Software/Downloads/">http://www.acedb.org/Software/Downloads/</A>
</dl>

<P>We've introduced the web pages to make it easier to navigate the acedb
downloads directories and get the download package you want.
On visiting <A href="http://www.acedb.org/Software/Downloads/">http://www.acedb.org/Software/Downloads/</A>
you will find there are three levels of code you can download and a
quick summary of the current build status available
at the bottom of the page.

<P>The three levels of code that can be downloaded are:
<dl>
  <dt><b>Public</b>
  <dd>This is the most stable and supported code. It has the fewest bugs and
      should be used for critical databases.
  <dt><b>Monthly</b>
  <dd>This is a montly build of the development code and will have been tested
      by developers and with the overnight build/test system. This code
      will have most of the latest features/bug fixes in it. The code is widely
      used within the Sanger Centre and should be fairly bug free, if you find
      a bug in this code please report it as soon as possible.
  <dt><b>Overnight</b>
  <dd>This code is the very latest and is not guaranteed to compile/run or anything,
      its there only to allow other developers to see the latest acedb code and
      perhaps to allow some users to try out very new features.
      <b>You shouldn't use this code without talking to the
      <A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb developers</A> first.</b>
</dl>

<P>If you visit the page for one of these levels of code you will see that there
are various packages that can be downloaded ranging from the source code, to
precompiled binaries for various platforms to a demonstration database. If you find
any problems with any aspect of the download pages then please let the
<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb developers</A> know.




<!--******************************************************************** -->
<a name="Bugs"></a><h2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="Drawing"></a><h3>Drawing performance bug</code></H3>

<P>Drawing of some fmap/gmap displays was very slow because a bug
in the acedb code was causing the displays to be drawn twice. This should
now be fixed for all acedb displays, please email the
<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb developers</A> if this is not
so in the latest monthly build code.

<P>A another smaller bug was that gmap code would try to map loci or regions
even if they had no given map coordinates, this has also been fixed. In this
case the loci/regions are displayed in a text window.

<a name="Objects"></a><h3>Objects missing from active keyset after rename</H3>

<P>Where a simple rename of an object was done via parsing an acefile,
the object was not left in the active keyset. Now the renamed object
will be in the active keyset allowing a quick check of renames.


<a name="Log"></a><h3>Log entries in <code>database/log.wrm</code></H3>

<P>Logging information in acedb was not complete because although the start
of a new user session was recorded, the end of the session was not. This meant
that if acedb failed in a way that could not be caught by the error handling
routines, there was no record in the log that this had happened.

<P>Now all session starts/ends shouid be bracketed by:

<pre><code>
&lt;date/time&gt; &lt;machine&gt; &lt;process&gt;  <b>SESSION_START -  </b>&lt;user/program details&gt;

&lt;date/time&gt; &lt;machine&gt; &lt;process&gt;  session information

&lt;date/time&gt; &lt;machine&gt; &lt;process&gt;  <b>SESSION_END -  </b>&lt;<b>session end type</b>&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>where <b><code>"session end type"</code></b> can be one of:
<dl>
  <dt><b><code>NORMAL EXIT</code></b>
  <dd>acedb program exitted normally.
  <dt><b><code>ABNORMAL EXIT</code></b>
  <dd>acedb program did not crash, but rather detected an error such as
      "database not found" and so could not continue.
  <dt><b><code>CRASH</code></b>
  <dd>acedb detected an unrecoverable error such as an internal programming fault,
      or the system running out of memory.
</dl>

<P>If a <b><code>SESSION_START</code></b> is found in the log without a corresponding
<b><code>SESSION_END</code></b>, this means (assuming the acedb program is no longer running)
that acedb crashed severely in a way
that it could not detect (e.g. if the program was killed with "kill -9" or on some
systems if it ran out of stack space). This type of crash <b>may</b> have left the database
corrupted if the program crashed while updating the database,
and certainly if the database does become corrupted you should look
in the log for either a <b><code>SESSION_END -  CRASH</code></b> or an unmatched
<b><code>SESSION_START</code></b>.

<p>Note that a little care is required in parsing the log file for these paired
starts and ends, process ids can be reused by the operating system. This means
that you need to first find the <b><code>"SESSION_START/machine/process_id"</code></b> and then
look for both a new <b><code>"SESSION_START/machine/same_process_id"</code></b> <I>and
a</I> <b><code>"SESSION_END/machine/process_id"</code></b>. If you find the former, or don't
find the latter it means the acedb program crashed severely.
