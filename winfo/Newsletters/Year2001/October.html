<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>

<P>A quiet month in preparation for the introduction of a major new facility for
constructing virtual sequences in acedb: Smap. This will be the subject of next
months newsletter when there will coverage of new code for putting together
DNA and the features on that DNA.

<P>There are some welcome additions to the way blixem can be run, both in terms
of speed and flexibility. There is also some new code for dumping just the CDS
parts of objects listed in the keyset window of xace.

<a name="blixem"></a><H3>Running Blixem from xace: new options</H3>

<P>Previously, if you used blixem from within xace then you cannot failed
to have noticed that sometimes blixem takes a long time to retrieve the
sequences it wants and that during this time xace is effectively "frozen"
and you cannot do any work. In addition if blixem should crash for any reason
then xace crashes to.

<P>These problems are caused by two aspects of the way blixem is being run:

<ol>
  <li>blixem makes a separate call to "efetch" for each sequence it needs and
      although efetch is fast, starting it up many times is not.
  <li>the blixem code is compiled in to xace to form a single program, hence
      if blixem crashes so does xace.
</ol>

<P>Two new features have been added to address these problems:

<ol>
  <li>blixem can now make a single call to a "pfetch" server to retrieve all
      sequences it requires in one go. This is <b><i>much</i></b> faster.
  <li>blixem can now be called as a separate program from within xace with the
      result that:
      <ul>
	<li>you can continue to work with xace while waiting for blixem to
	    retrieve sequences and display the results.
	<li>you can start up as many blixems as you want, you are not
	    restricted to one blixem per xace.
	<li>if blixem crashes, xace will continue to run and you can
	    start a new blixem.
      </ul>
</ol>



<P>You can control how blixem is run from the preferences menu, the following
preferences have been added:

<dl>
  <dt><b>BLIXEM_EXTERNAL</b>
  <dd>Select this option if you want blixem to be called as an external program.
  <dt><b>BLIXEM_PFETCH</b>
  <dd>Select this option if you want blixem to use "pfetch" instead of "efetch" to
      obtain its sequences.

      <P>You should then set the following preferences so that blixem can find
      the pfetch server (you should contact your local pfetch administrator if
      you don't know what values to use):
      <dl>
	<dt><b>BLIXEM_NETID</b>
	<dd>Set this to either the dotted decimal, e.g. "999.9.99.99" or the
	    text form, e.g. "hal" of the network address of the server.
	<dt><b>BLIXEM_PORT_NUMBER</b>
	<dd>Set this to the port number that the pfetch server is listening on,
	    e.g. 2001
      </dl> 
</dl>

<P>Note that <b>BLIXEM_EXTERNAL</b> and <b>BLIXEM_PFETCH</b> can be set independently
to one another so you can have any combination of the two.

<P>If you are using blixem as a separate program and want to set it to use pfetch
then you can do this in two ways:

<dl>
  <dt><b>environment variables</b>
  <dd>You can use two environment variables to make blixem use pfetch:
      <dl>
	<dt><b>BLIXEM_PFETCH</b>
	<dd>e.g. "setenv BLIXEM_PFETCH hal"
	<dt><b>BLIXEM_PORT</b>
	<dd>e.g. "setenv BLIXEM_PORT 2001"
      </dl>
      The examples assume you use csh.
  <dt><b>command line options</b>
  <dd>
      <dl>
	<dt><b>-P nodeid<:port></b>
	<dd>You can specify the machine and port number with as an option to blixem,
	    e.g. <b>blixem -P hal:2001  rest_of_blixem_args</b>
      </dl>
</dl>

<P>blixem will use the environment variables when run from xace as well, but you are
recommended to control blixems use of pfetch via the preferences menu.


<a name="cds_fasta"></a><H3>Dumping CDS from the Keyset window</H3>

<P>A new option has been added to dump just the CDS dna or corresponding
protein translation in FastA format from
a set of objects in the keyset window. From the "Export.." menu, select
"CDS DNA in Fasta format" or "CDS Protein in Fasta format". If an object
in the window does not contain the CDS tag then nothing will be dumped for that object.

<P>Fmap now displays cursor co-ords during middle-button drag.

<a name="aceio_tmp"></a><H3>New routines for the aceTmp package</H3>

<P>Some new routines/options have been added to the aceTmp package:

<dl>
  <dt><b>aceTmpCreateDir()</b>
  <dd>Creates a directory and then creates a temporary file within that directory, this
      makes it more convenient to put all temporary files of a particular type
      into a single subdirectory of <b>/tmp</b> for instance.
  <dt><b>aceTmpNoRemove()</b>
  <dd>By default aceTmp removes any temporary files that it creates, this is not always
      desireable, so you can use this call to stop file removal. It is of course then
      your responsibility to remove the file, you can use the unix "<b>unlink</b>" call to
      do this:
<pre>               char *tmpfile_name ;
               ACETMP tmpfile ;

               tmpfile = aceTmpCreate( args ) ;
 
               tmpfile_name = aceTmpGetFileName(tmpfile) ;
               aceTmpNoRemove(tmpfile) ;

               /* some time later */
               unlink(tmpfile_name) ;
</pre> 
</dl>


<a name="bindexfind_stuff"></a><H3>Some comments about the use of bIndexFind()</H3>

<P>(<I>Thanks to Jean Thierry-Mieg for his comments</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>There have been a number of emails about bIndexFind() recently and it's
probably good to summarise some of these:

<p>bIndexFind() was designed to speed up queries by referencing an in memory
table to determine whether an object contains a particular tag, rather than
reading the object in, opening it and searching for the tag. The speed up is
enormous.

<P>So what's the problem ? The main problem is that bIndexFind() <b>does not</b> simply
return a boolean, i.e. TRUE if it can find the tag in the index, FALSE if not. The
call returns one of three possible values:
<dl>
  <dt><b>BINDEX_TAG_ABSENT (= 0)</b>
  <dd>The tag is absent from the index.
  <dt><b>BINDEX_TAG_UNCLEAR (= 1)</b>
  <dd>Currently this can be returned for a whole host of reasons: the index is not up to date,
      bindex package has not been initialised, the supplied key is a protected class or
      is not a B object or, well quite a few other factors really (see below for more
      on this). 
  <dt><b>BINDEX_TAG_PRESENT (= 2)</b>
  <dd>The tag is present in the index.
</dl>

<p>This means that it is not safe to write code like this assuming that because you
have entered the "if" clause all is OK:

<pre><code>if (bIndexFind (obj, tag))
  {
    some actions....
  }
</code></pre>

<P>this can fail because bIndexFind() may return <b>BINDEX_TAG_UNCLEAR</b>.

<P>Safer is to use two functions written by Jean which handle the
bIndexFind() return values: 

<pre><code><b>KEY keyGetKey(KEY key, KEY tag) ;
BOOL keyFindTag(KEY key, KEY tag) ;
</b></code></pre>

<P>These use the index where possible and only open the object if necessary.

<P>It is also safe to use bIndexFind() to speed up operations in some circumstances,
e.g. If you were going to do this:

<pre><code><b>if ((obj = bsCreate())
  {
    if (bsGetData (obj,tag,...))
      { ... }
    bsDestroy (obj) ;
  }
</b></code></pre>

<P>you could instead do this:

<pre><code><b>if ((bIndexFind(obj, tag) != BINDEX_TAG_ABSENT) && (obj = bsCreate())
  {
    if (bsGetData (obj,tag,...))
      { ... }
    bsDestroy (obj) ;
  }
</b></code></pre>

<P>the latter is faster if the tag is <b>not</b> found in the index because the
object does not need to be opened, and it's safe because otherwise we then go on
to open the object and look for the tag anyway.

<P>Currently bIndexFind() returns <b>BINDEX_TAG_UNCLEAR</b> for a number of conditions
which are likely to be coding errors, we should consider messcrashing for these
instead, e.g. if the index has not been initialised, trying to find a tag with a value
less than "_Date" and maybe others. Send any thoughts on this to:
