<a name="ftp_http"></a><H3>Downloading acedb</H3>

<P>The Sanger Centre has had to tighten up security on its ftp and web sites.
This has meant that some users have had trouble downloading via ftp because
their own ftp is not configured to use passive mode which is the only supported
mode at the Sanger Centre now.

<P>Do please remember that you can download everything from our
<A HREF="http://www.acedb.org/Software/Downloads/">web page for downloads</A>
using either ftp or http protocols, the latter will avoid
any problems you may have with ftp.

<a name="silent_option"></a><H3>New "-silent" command line for Socket Server</H3>

<P>The server can now be run in the foreground in "silent" mode, i.e. no
messages are sent to the terminal. Specify the "-silent" option when starting
the server. This option was requested to make it possible to run the server
for extended periods of time in an xterm without huge numbers of messages
being output to the terminal.

<a name="port_numbers"></a><H3>The Socket Server and port numbers.</H3>

<P>There has been some confusion over the valid range of port numbers for the
socket server. IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has set aside certain ranges of port
numbers for certain uses with sockets:

<PRE><CODE>

Port No. range          Usage
--------------          -----

0 - 1023                "well-known" ports, you need super user authority
                        to use these and they are reserved for ftp, http,
                        X windows and basic operating system services.
                        <b>DO NOT USE THESE</b>.

1024 - 49151            "registered" ports, if you setting up the server to
                        be run by inetd you should use one of these.
                        <B>But</B> you will need to check in /etc/services
                        that your number does not clash with one already there.

49152 - 65535           "dynamic" ports, are for dynamically assigned/ephemeral
                        use. You should use one of these if you are just trying
                        out the server from an xterm in the foreground.

</CODE></PRE>

<P>You should <b>not</b> choose a port larger than 65535. If you do, the port
number may be truncated in a way that leaves it in the range 0 - 1023 which are
reserved for superuser use for well-known services. Numbers larger than 65535 are
generally reserved for RPC and not available for sockets.


<a name="core_dump"></a><H3>Change in behaviour when acedb crashes.</H3>

<P>In the past when acedb crashed it produced a core dump. Unfortunately this
dump is often useless because acedb attempts to clean up the database before
the core dump by setting up a special routine called a signal catcher.
This means that the core dump records what was going on when
acedb was cleaning up, not what caused the crash.

<P>Now, by default, no core dump will be produced. Instead, if acedb crashes in
a way that you can reproduce,
you should restart it with the "-nosigcatch" command line option, e.g.:

<pre><code>tace -nosigcatch your_database
</code></pre>

<P>This will tell acedb not to try to clear up when it crashes and the operating
system will then produce a useful core dump when the problem reoccurs. You should
keep this core dump and let the
<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb developers</A>
know about it.

<P>If you are using xace, you can also turn signal catching on and off from the
Admin menu on the main window.

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>

<a name="grey_ramp"></a><H3>Greyramp speed improved.</H3>

<P>The grey ramp printing code was preforming a function call per pixel, this
has now been fixed which should speed things up a lot.

<a name="aceout_print"></a><H3>The last of the aceOutPrint() bugs ?</H3>

<P>When the aceOut package was introduced it unfortunately encouraged some
erroneous use of the aceOutPrint() call (which should really be called aceOutPrint<b>f</b>()).
The problem occurs when programmers do this:
<pre><code>char *some_string = "blah, blah, resulting in a large % gain, blah, blah" ;

aceOutPrint(some_string) ;
</code></pre>
What they should really do is this:
<pre><code>char *some_string = "blah, blah, resulting in a large % gain, blah, blah" ;

aceOutPrint("%s", some_string) ;
</code></pre>
In the former, the "%" in some_string is taken as a formatting character and the code
looks in probably undefined memory to get the data to be formatted.

<P>All occurences of this in acedb code have now been fixed and the header for the
aceOut package updated to warn programmers about this problem. A longer term fix
will be to introduce an aceOutPrintf() function to take the place of the aceOutPrint()
call, which will become a routine to print simple strings.

<a name="dotter"></a><H3>Dotter bug.</H3>

<P>Dotter was crashing periodically, this was because of a problem passing
the data over to the forked off dotter via a pipe. This should now be fixed.

<a name="alias"></a><H3>Serious alias bug</H3>

<P>Jean Thierry-Mieg discovered a serious bug which affected the use of aliases
with acedbs cache of the tags present in an object. The cache is used to speed
up queries since it makes it possible to see if an object contains a particular
tag without actually having to load the object.

<P>The code was not de-aliasing names and so would report a tag missing from
an object because it did not look up the true object underlying the alias in
the cache. This should make aliases much more reliable to use.

<a name="Developers_Corner"></a><H2>Developers Corner</H2>

<a name="libgif_renamed"></a><H3>libgif.a renamed to libgd.a</H3>

<P>The library that contains the GD package for producing acedb images used to
be called libgif.a, it has now been renamed to libgd.a because of a name clash
with a library on the new Mac OS-X system. This more accurately reflects the
library's contents in any case since it is based on the GD package.

<H2>No December monthly build</H2>

<P>Due to problems with our build system and some large scale and unfinished
changes to introduce Smap (see January issue) we were not able to produce
a December monthly build. Sorry !
