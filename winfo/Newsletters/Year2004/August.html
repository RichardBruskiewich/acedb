<a name="acedb_php"></a><H3>A PHP interface to AceDB</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Hamish McWilliam</I>
<A HREF="mailto:software@hpm101.gotadsl.co.uk">software@hpm101.gotadsl.co.uk</A>)

<P>Hamish McWilliam has been working on a PHP interface to AceDB, here's what
he has to say about it:

<P><b>AcePHP: a PHP interface to AceDB</b>
                                                                                          
<P>While AcePerl is wonderful for scripts and web applications, it is                        
problematic when a small amount of dynamic content is required in an                       
otherwise static page. PHP is an ideal solution for this circumstance                     
and since it supports sockets it is possible to use the AceDB socket                      
server to access data in an AceDB database, and embed it in the page. To                  
faciliate this a PHP library has been developed that allows access to                     
most of the capabilites of AceDB. This library is pure PHP so no                          
re-compilation of the web server is required. For simple object counts                    
in a database description or one off queries in otherwise static web                      
pages I can think of no simpler method.                                                   

<P>It's now works well for
simple things like object counts for a query, number of objects in a class or small queries,
there are still some problems handling large objects.

<P>If you want to have a play with it, you can find details, crude demos                     
and downloads at:

</pre>

<P>Hamish.                                                                                   




<a name="opteron"></a><H3>Opteron port</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Meig</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>Jean has added a new defs file to the wmake directory, <b>OPTERON_4_DEF</b>,
for compiling AceDB on the Opteron
which should help to ease the problems that some people have experienced in
referencing the correct libraries for building AceDB on this 64-bit Linux
platform.

<P>Please note that while the all the binaries from the AceDB source package
have been compiled and run on the Opteron, other extensions to AceDB, e.g. AcePerl, are
yet to be ported.



<a name="smap_cmds"></a><H3>Some New SMap commands</H3>

<P>For some time now there has been an smap command in giface that enables you to
find out the coordinates of a feature in a parent:


<pre><code>acedb-gif&gt; smap -from cds:b0250.4 -to sequence:b0250
SMAP Sequence:B0250 7671 1839 1 1443 INTERNAL_GAPS
// 1 Active Objects
acedb-gif&gt;
</code></pre>

<P>(N.B. "<code>INTERNAL_GAPS</code>" is returned because cds:b0250.4 consists of exons
and introns and hence its mapping to sequence:b0250 is not contiguous.)

<P>The command defaults to finding a feature in that features ultimate parent in the database:

<pre><code>acedb-gif&gt; smap -from sequence:b0250
SMAP Sequence:CHROMOSOME_V 20454867 20494082 1 39216 PERFECT_MAP
acedb-gif&gt;
</code></pre>


<P>This command is now available in tace and giface (and the corresponding servers),
it has been added to the base command menu so there is no need to go into the gif
submenu. (Note the smap command has been left in the gif submenu for compatibility
with scripts/aceperl programs that rely on this.)

<P>There are now two additional commands in the base command menu that access SMap functions:

<ul>
  <li><b><code>smapdump:</code></b> dumps a text version of the complete SMap
      for an object to the terminal.
  <li><b><code>smaplength:</code></b> gives the length of an object (this is not always
      obvious as the objects length may be given by the maximum extent of the coordinates
      of its S_Child features or may be specified explicitly in its S_Parent object).
</ul>


<P>Output from smaplength is simply the length of the object:

<pre><code>acedb&gt; smaplength sequence:b0250
SMAPLENGTH Sequence:"B0250" 39216
// 1 Active Objects
acedb&gt;
</code></pre>


<P>Output from smapdump may be voluminous:

<pre><code>acedb&gt; smapdump cds:B0250.4
SMAPDUMP CDS:"B0250.4"

sMap->nnnn:
        sMap->length = 1443
        sMap->area1 = 1, sMap->area2 = 1443

sMap->root->nnnn:
        Root = Sequence:"CHROMOSOME_V" [20462537,20456705]
        sMapLength = 1443

<P>You can see descriptions of smap* command usage online:

<pre><code>acedb&gt; ? smap*
// Keyword smap* does not match
// ACEDB list of commands matching smap**:
smap [-coords x1 x2] -from class:object [-to class:object] :
             maps cordinates between sequences that have a child -> parent relationship expressed in SMap tags (or the now deprecated Source/Subsequence tags).
             Note that objects must be specified in "class:object" as smap can map any class that contains SMap tags.
        -coords x1 x2      coords to be mapped in the -from object, defaults to whole of -from object.
        -from class:object object to be mapped into one of its parent.
        -to class:object   object to be mapped to, must be a parent of the -from object, defaults to top parent in the smap tree above -from object.
smapdump class:object : dumps to stdout the smap for the object.
smaplength class:object : gives the length of the object.
// 1 Active Objects

<a name="quiet_cmds"></a><H3>New quiet command</H3>

<P>AceDB terminal output usually includes comments at the end even if the command worked:
<pre><code>acedb&gt; gif seqget 1.12985533-13293939 ; seqfeatures -file myfile
##gff-version 2

          (many more lines)

// 15 Active Objects
acedb&gt;
</code></pre>

<P>For interactive use of tace, giface, the servers, this is very important as it gives the user
feedback about the command and the active keyset. This may not be so good for programs that must
parse the output as they must all be coded to process the comment lines.

<P>The new "quiet" command (which is available from the base or gif command menus) suppresses
AceDB comments when the command works but passes the comment through if the command
fails. This allows a program to easily parse the output and detect whether the command succeeded or
failed. With quiet mode on in the above example either valid GFF lines would be returned or
a comment because there was an error.

<P>The command description is:
<pre><code>acedb&gt; ? quiet
// ACEDB command: quiet
quiet -on | -off :
        Turn quiet mode on or off, when "on" commands produce only their output without any extra comments.
        (Note the usual "NNN Active Objects" is no longer displayed, use the Count command.)
        Quiet mode makes parsing command output easier because either the first line
        is an acedb comment because the command failed or there are no acedb comments in the output.
        -off    (default) verbose output
        -on     no comments unless there is an error.

// 0 Active Objects
acedb&gt;
</code></pre> 

<P>(Note that if you turn quiet mode on in the base menu then it will also be on in the gif
menu.)

<P>Full support of this option for all commands will take time to implement so if you
find a command which does not produce "quiet" output as you would expect please email
<A HREF="mailto:acedb@sanger.ac.uk">acedb@sanger.ac.uk</A> with examples.

<a name="embl_acc"></a><H3>Change to how EMBL dumping in AceDB dumps accession numbers</H3>

<P>There has been a change to the way AceDB embl dumping works for accession numbers,
the changes have been made to support new tags in wormbase.

<P>The original tags that the embl dump code read the accession number from were:

<pre>        Database ?Database ?Text ?Accession_number
</pre>

<P>This worked while accession data was stored in this form:
                                                                                          
<pre>    ?Sequence C04G2                                                                       
    Database EMBL CEC04G2 Z70718                                                          
</pre>

<P>The accession number dumped for the above was: "z70718".

<P>The new tags in worm are:
                                                                                          
<pre>        Database ?Database ?Database_field ?Accession_number

        (n.b. change of ?Text to ?Database_field, but essentially the same)
</pre>                                                                                          

<P>In particular the accession number is now specified by the object following
a ?Database_field object with the name "NDB_AC":
                                                                                          
<pre>  ?Sequence C04G2                                                                         
    Database EMBL    NDB_ID    CEC04G2                                                    
             EMBL    NDB_AC    Z70718                                                
             EMBL    NDB_SV    Z70718.1                                              
</pre>

<P>The old code would return "CEC04G2" as the accession number which is not correct, the
new code will return "z70718".



<a name="gff_feature"></a><H3>Extension to how AceDB handles GFF_feature in the Method class</H3>


<P>The ?Method class allows you to specify, via the GFF_feature tag, some text
that will be output as the "feature type name" in the GFF dump of all features that
specify that method.

<P>The current model for specifying GFF_feature is:

<pre>?Method
     GFF_feature UNIQUE Text
</pre>

<P>Wormbase now uses the controlled vocabularly of the Sequence Ontology (SO)
project to specify these types. In wormbase these terms are stored as the names
of objects of a new class ?SO_term. Hence their model is now:

<pre>?Method
     GFF_feature UNIQUE ?SO_term
</pre>

<P>The GFF dumping code in AceDB has now been altered to cope with both formats
of data so you can leave your database unchanged or move, as Wormbase has, towards
a more controlled ontology.

<a name="AQL_active"></a><H3>AQL and the active keyset</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Meig</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>According to the AQL documentation, it is possible to initiate an                         
AQL query on the active keyset, known in aql as '@active' . This is very handy,           
because the active keyset may result from a complex set of operations that                
cannot be reproduced by the AQL command line, for example it may result from              
reading an external file or be constructed by a web cgi script.                           
                                                                                          
<P>Example:                                                                                  
                                                                                          
<pre>acedb&gt; keyset-read my_paper_list.ace                                                      
acedb&gt; aql select p,a from p in @active:1, a in p->author                                 
</pre>

<P>Unfortunately, there was for some time a bug in the definition of the AQL                 
@active table. This is fixed, and the @active construction works again.

<a name="ace_c"></a><H3>Acelib.h to AceC transition</H3>

<P>(<I>This article is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Meig</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>In 1997, a tentative C interface to acedb, called acelib                                  
was proposed by Greg Miller. This interface was implemented                               
but, as far as we know, never used<b>*</b>. Indeed, the interface                                
was rather more complicated to use on the server side                                     
than the direct ace kernel calls, and could not be used                                   
on the client side.                                                                       
                                                                                          
<P>Now that the new AceC C programmers interface is fully                                    
deployed, and tested both on server and on client side,                                   
we intend to totally remove the previous acelib code.                                     
                                                                                          
<P>This means that the file acelib.h will disappear and                                      
anyone who was using it in one of its application                                         
will have to include in its place wac/ac.h and to

<P><b>*</b><i>The only known usage of acelib is that the
acedb kernel itself is using it during bootstrap.                                         
The bit of acelib used in this way will be        
kept, but will become private to the acedb kernel.</i>



<a name="graph_text"></a><H3>Text Editor Bug</H3>

<P>(<I>This fix is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Meig</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>There was a bug in the Text Editor code in AceDB which meant that it would crash if
you tried to create an editor of length &lt; 16, fixed
now.




<a name="name_decorate"></a><H3>Displaying object class and name</H3>

<P>For sometime there has been a call in AceDB to return a string which is a compound
of an objects name and class (from wh/acedb.h):

<pre>char *nameWithClass(KEY k) ;				    /* returns   class:name   */
</pre>

<P>Some users found this confusing however as their databases adopted a convention of including
the ":" character in the objects name so the result of this function when displayed
would give something like:

<pre><b>someclass:some:very:long:name</b>
</pre>

<P>There is now a new function in wh/acedb.h:

<pre>char *nameWithClassDecorate(KEY k) ;			    /* returns   class:"name" */
</pre>

<P>You can use this call to get a less ambiguous string that can be displayed to
the user:

<pre><b>someclass:"some:very:long:name"</b>
</pre>



<a name="messubs"></a><H3>messubs changes</H3>

<P>(<I>This fix is courtesy of Jean Thierry-Meig</I>
<A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>)

<P>Jean has fixed a couple of bugs and closed a loophole in the message
formatting code which is a fundamental part of AceDB. The original loophole
was caused by long standing inadequacies in the ANSI C libraries for string
formatting into fixed buffers.

<P>Thanks to Jean for sorting this out.


<a name="bssubs"></a><H3>New function to return the name of an object from an OBJ pointer.</H3>

<P>A trivial addition but useful when running in a debugger, the new call will return
the name of an object given an object pointer, from wh/bs.h:

<pre>char *bsName(OBJ obj) ;					    /* return the name of an object */
</pre>
