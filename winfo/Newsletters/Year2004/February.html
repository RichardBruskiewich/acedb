<!-- ******************************************************************** -->
<P><hr width="62%" align=left>

<P>A month of mostly bug fixes.

<a name="RedHat"></a><H3>AceDB compiles on RedHat 9</H3>

<P>We now have AceDB compiling on the RedHat 9 version of Linux which uses the
newer versions of Glib and the GTK toolkit. You need to get the latest monthly
release and set the ACEDB_MACHINE
environment variable to "LINUX_4_RH9" to compile on RedHat 9.

<a name="Bugs_Fixed"></a><H2>Bugs Fixed</H2>


<a name="embl"></a><H3>Embl dumping bugs</H3>

<P>Embl dumping was broken for one release because in fixing a problem with
checking that #EMBL_dump_info is specified correctly I forgot to ensure that
I jumped back out of the #EMBL_dump_info submodel before checking for further
tags, pathetic.

<P> Also, for worm group, I have disabled the accession number output
because they have changed their model completely and the existing
code simply won't work. They now put in the accession number via an external script.


<a name="blixem_crash"></a><H3>Blixem crash</H3>

<P>blixem was crashing with some sequences/homologies and it turns out that this
is because some gaps array mappings were not being clipped properly resulting in blixem
attempting to access non-existent sequence data. This is now fixed.


<a name="confirmed_introns"></a><H3>Confirmed introns crash</H3>

<P>Sometimes confirmed_introns caused acedb to crash, it turns out this
was caused by the transition from fmap working at the "whole clone"
level, i.e. bringing in all of any clones required to make up an
fmap, to fmap clipping adjacent clones.

<P>In this case it meant that confirmed introns of an adjoining
clone were not getting mapped, this was fine until we had the
situation where we had a confirmed intron being confirmed from 2
different sources. This is effectively two introns with the same
coords but different confirmations.  The first one did not get
mapped correctly but because the second one had the same coords
the code assumed it had been mapped and so tried to process the
second intron as though everything was ok. Now when introns have
the same coords we check to see if the previous intron was
actually mapped.


<a name="composite_classes"></a><H3>Composite class bug</H3>

<P>Fix bug in pickRegisterClassMasks(), code
assumed that a bsFlatten array only has 4 byte fields in it but
this is not true on the Alpha as one of the union members is a
pointer which is 8 bytes. This bug prevented acedb from
initialising on the Alphas if composite classes were declared in
subclasses.wrm.


<a name="blixem_sort"></a><H3>Blixem sort bug</H3>

<P>Fix bug which meant that only the sequences
passed in from acedb got sorted initially, the sequences obtained
from another source (e.g. pfetch) did not get sorted until user
selected a sort method. Now all sequences are sorted from the start.

<a name="xacez_target"></a><H3>xacez target</H3>

<P>As part of the ZMap development it is our intention to add a "ZMap" display
type to acedb and to facilitate development Rob has created a new target called
xacez.

<P>This target is not compileable at the moment but will become so as we develop
the ZMap display.


<a name="blixem_crash_more"></a><H3>More on the Blixem crash</H3>

<P>The main cause of this problem is two fold: the homology conversion routine was
not recording any clipping of the main homology start/end coordinates by the SMapMap()
call. More seriously, sMapLocalMap() does not take any notice of the start/end coords
that are passed to it and does not return a mapping status to indicate any clipping.

<P>Currently this is fixed by mapping each gap separately so we can detect if it gets
mapped correctly. The better fix is to sort out sMapLocalMap() and this will be done
in the next month or so.
