<P>A very brief (and late) newsletter for January as both Rob and I have been
working mostly on ZMap or DAS 2 issues. There will be a report of progress
on ZMap next month.

<P>Jean has added further optimisations to the Query language to improve the performance
when using COUT.

<P>He has also added webQuery, a registered acembly uitility for users of acembly,
please contact <A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">Jean Thierry-Mieg</A> for details.

<a name="more_smap"></a><H3>More SMap Related Changes</H3>

<P>A number of changes have been made to support the introduction of new classes
for sequence annotation in worm base:

<P>In the <b>Sequence</b> class the Source_Exons tag was preceded by a "From" tag:

<pre><code>	  Structure  From	Source UNIQUE ?Sequence
				Source_Exons Int UNIQUE Int // start at 1
</code></pre>

<P>A dependency in the Temporary Gene code of FMap on the "From" tag has been removed
allowing embedding of just the "Source_Exons" tag set into any SMappable class.

<P>The temporary gene code now copies the "CDS", "Start_not_found"
and "End_not_found" tags into the temporary gene in a more consistent way.

<P>Any class that contains 
"Source_Exon" and/or "CDS" tags will now behave like a Sequence class objects
for display, dumping etc. giving a consistent look/feel to the way such objects
can be annotated. Note that the
code now prints a warning if you have a "CDS" tag in an object but no defined "Source_exons".
Previously the code manufactured a source exon for dumping/display if one did not exist,
but a discussion
with the worm group suggested that this sort of implicit production of features was leading
to undetected data inconsistencies.

<a name="treedisp"></a><H3>Tree Display Update Bug</H3>

<P>A bug which meant that text editting was broken in the Update Tree Display mode
after a mouse click in the window has been fixed.


<a name="dna_dump"></a><H3>DNA exporting coordinate bug in FMap</H3>

<P>A woeful bug in the code that reports DNA assuming it begins at zero instead of 1
has been fixed. This was resulting in the start/end coords in the FASTA file being one
less than they should have been.

<a name="GTK2"></a><H3>GTK version 2 is coming</H3>

<P>The next monthly build will see wmake/XXXXX_DEF files for compiling acedb
with GTK version 2 for both the Alpha and Linux. This will be an important move
as the newer version of GTK fixes many bugs and has some good new features.
We also need to move versions because the previous GTK version is no longer
supported.


<a name="xacz"></a><H3>xacez, xace + ZMap</H3>

<P>The acedb makefile system now includes an "xacez" target which builds an
xace execuatable which includes the display part of the new ZMap code. This is
completely experimental so please don't report bugs on it yet. The intention
is to allow part of the ZMap code to be embedded in xace so annotators here at
Sanger can
try out the display as early as possible.
