ACEDB futures pages.

These pages record possible changes to ACEDB, they are organised to allow looking
at the pages with or without the use of frames.


Dependencies:

NOTE that these pages make use of a style file in the directory below called acedocs.css
(referenced by relative directory), this is intended to be a general style file for
acedb documents.


Organisation:

The pages are organised like this:

				   index.shtml		(*)count_monitor.html
					|
		--------------------------------------------------------
	       |							|
	       |							V
	       |           			(**)		  frame_init.html
	       |				frame_short.html  frame_medium.html  frame_long.html
	       |					    top_index.html   blank.html
	       |							|
	       |							|
	       |							|
		------------------------                 ---------------
					|		|
					V		V
			----------------------------------------------
		       |			|		      |
		       V			V		      V
		short_index.html	medium_index.html	long_index.html
		       |			|		      |
		       V			V		      V
		short_term.html		medium_term.html	long_term.html


(*)	Usage of the pages is monitored by hidden counters on the following pages:

	index.shtml, short_term.html, medium_term.html, long_term.html

	the 'hidden' page count_monitor.html can be linked to in order to see at a 
	glance the usage counts for these pages.

(**)	This slightly complicated arrangement of frames allows us to change two windows within
	the frames layout with a single click on a hypertext link. The top_index.html simply has
	links to frame_short/medium/long.html, blank.html is a blank document with a white
	background. frame_short/medium/long.html have the links to show the indexes to the
	short, medium and long documents.


index.shtml:	does not require frames and presents the user with a choice of frame or non-frame
		based indexing.
