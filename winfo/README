		The ACEDB Documentation directory.
		==================================

Documents in acedb come in three flavours:

      wdoc - is for documentation of all interfaces to acedb code, should contain
             descriptions of programming interfaces (how to use routines,
             tricks/tips etc.), descriptions of command & config file interfaces
             (e.g. how to set up the the server etc.). These files are distributed
             with the source.
             CURRENTLY this directory contains some specs, I think these would be
             better placed in winfo.

     whelp - is for online help for acedb. These files are distributed with the
             source.

     winfo - is for all other types of acedb documentation, e.g. the "Futures"
             documents that describe possible future directions for acedb, in
             depth design documents etc.
             These documents are not usually distributed with the source.

Documents that you add to this directory should fall in the last category above.
The intention of this directory is act as a repository for the many different bits
of acedb documentation that are just floating around.

Do not just chuck stuff in at the winfo level. Instead use an existing
sub-directory, if you can't find one then add a new one and add a comment
to the list at the bottom of this document explaining its contents.

If your document is referenced from the acedb home page, you can have the latest
copy from CVS made available on the acedb home page automatically. You need to
edit the script ~acedb/cvsscripts/updateftpdoc, see the examples of the "Futures"
documents or whelp etc.
