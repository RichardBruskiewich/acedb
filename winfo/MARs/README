AceDB MARs (Monthly Activity Reports)
=====================================


These are largely derived from the Newsletter stuff. But also include
any comments team members may have.

Prior to September 2003 they were written by Simon Kelley and we have
not kept copies, no big deal.

They are plain text files and must have a an "Executive Summary" paragraph
which is shown once a month at the group meetings.
