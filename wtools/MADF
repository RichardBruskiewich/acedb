# This is an example of how to run MakeAceDB, providing the run-time parameters
# in a command file.  In this case, the command file is MakeAceDB.com and resides
# in the current directory.
# I use it for testing, hence the need to remove the existing "newdb" directory.

if [ -d newdb ]
then
	rm -r newdb

./MakeAceDB -f MakeAceDB.com
