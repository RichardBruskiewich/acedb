Notes: 
With version 4.9u, dotter and blixem have been split off and
are now shipped as a separate distribution on the Mac.  Acedb is not
dependent on dotter and blixem being present, but if you want to
run dotter or blixem as standalones, you must install them separately.

I haven't yet got around to writing an installer for dotter and
blixem, so if you want to build them from the source, you'll have
to do so by hand.  It's pretty simple, just not fully automated yet.

If this README isn't sufficiently clear or contains errors, please 
email me at webmaster@acedb.org.


To install the binaries, use the debian package manager:

dpkg -i dotterandblixem_4.9.27-1_darwin-powerpc.deb



To build and install them:

Make a .info file for the latest version using command

mkinfo_dotblix <version> <revision>


Put the .info file in /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/database

To build:

fink build dotterandblixem

This downloads the source files from the acedb website, compiles them all
and creates a .deb file which it leaves in

/sw/fink/dists/local/main/binary-darwin-powerpc/database


To install:

fink install dotterandblixem

or you could go to where the deb file is and install using dpkg

dpkg -i dotterandblixem_4.9.27-1_darwin-powerpc.deb


If you want to upgrade to the latest version, you'll need to 

fink rebuild dotterandblixem

to force fink to download a fresh tarfile.  Otherwise it just uses the deb it
already has, which is not what you want.
