Notes: 
With version 4.9u, dotter and blixem have been split off and
are now shipped as a separate distribution on the Mac.  The standard
AceDB is shipped with blixem built-in, but there is an option to
run it standalone.  Dotter is not part of acedb. 

If you want to run blixem standalone or dotter, you'll need to install
them separately.  The package can be downloaded from our website,
www.acedb.org.

If you're running the binary prepared by the AceDB development team,
you don't need to run aceinstall.  However, if you want to download
the source and build your own binary, aceinstall is designed to
automate the process as much as possible.

To install the binaries, use the debian package manager:

dpkg -i acedb_4.9p-1_darwin-powerpc.deb

To build and install AceDB:


Run the csh script aceinstall at the command prompt as follows:

	aceinstall <version> <revision> [gtk]
    eg  aceinstall 4.9p 1 gtk
    or  aceinstall 4.9p 1

The script can handle either a dot or underscore in the version, 
but the final result is always a dot, as debion requires that.

If xfree86 etc are already installed, leave off the final "gtk".

If you've done the installation before and the .deb file already exists,
the script will need to know how to proceed.  You can quit, skip to the 
next phase using the existing .deb file or remove the file and proceed 
as for a clean install.

You may be prompted for your password once or twice.

The script should do everything for you.  In case it doesn't, here are
the old instructions.  It's the same as what the script does, only
you have to do everything by hand. 

If it's broken, please let me know - webmaster@acedb.org.

To build:

Make a .info file for the latest version using command

mkinfo <version> <revision>


Put the .info file in /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/database
run fink build acedb which leaves a .deb file in

/sw/fink/dists/local/main/binary-darwin-powerpc/database

You can copy this to a convenient location or run the install from 
there.

To install:

fink install x11 gtk+2 readline

Obviously you don't need to to that if they're already there.

dpkg -i acedb_4.9p-1_darwin-powerpc.deb
