These are Acedb fink packages for use on Mac OS X, version 10.1 and above.

Before use you will need to install Fink, from
http://fink.sourceforge.net/

then run the command

sudo fink install x11 gtk+2 readline

to install other software needed by acedb.

Finally download the acedb package file and run the command 

sudo dpkg -i acedb_4.9j-1_darwin-powerpc.deb

to install acedb. (Obviously, substitute the name of the actual 
file you download in the above command.)


Actually, these instructions are a little out of date.  If you
use fink to build and install acedb, you should find that the
dependencies built into its mkinfo file will take care of all
that.  Fink should get x11, readline and gtk+2 first, then
go on and install acedb.

So fink install acedb should be all you need.
