lipfetch notes

 - please read before messing about with the way this code is built.


libpfetch is taken from code that Roy Storey wrote for zmap. In that case the
code was autoconf'd but we don't use autoconf for acedb so I copied the makefiles
from zmap and hacked them to make everything compile here. Accordingly there is a
lot of junk in the Makefile that doesn't need to be there and the Makefile does
not operate correctly for all targets.

This was expedient but also fits in more with the acedb philosophy of not using
anything autoconf-like.
