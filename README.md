# acedb

This is the official github repository of the Sanger Institute branch of
acedb (also capitalised as ACeDB, Acedb, ACEDB etc.).

Acedb was originally
developed by Jean Thierry-Mieg and Richard Durbin starting in 1990, with
subsequent substantial additions down the years from Freb Wobus, Simon Kelley, Ed Griffiths
and others.  Around 2000 there was a major fork, with one branch developed and maintained by [mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](Jean
Thierry-Mieg at NCBI), with in particular extensive additions for assembly and
 RNAseq data analysis, and the other banch maintained by a series
of individuals at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, with in
particular the addition of the zmap code used by the Havana vertebrate
gene annotation group.  This repository contains the second branch.
In October 2016 ongoing active support of this second branch by Ed
Griffiths and his team at the Sanger Insitute came to an end, and the 
code was archived in this repository at
[https://github.com/richarddurbin/acedb](github.com/richarddurbin/acedb).

The original READMEs and other documentation, dating from different times, can be found in
