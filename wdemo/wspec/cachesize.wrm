// @(#)cachesize.wrm	1.3    5/10/95
//  acedb auxiliary file : wspec/cachesize.wrm
// 
//  This file indicates the size of the 2 caches
//
//  It is read once during initialisation of the program,
//  If this file is absent or cannot be read, the values
//  defaults as indicated in the source code blocksubs.c
//  i.e. 1000 and 1000 as of release 1-8
//
//  Cache1 is an image of the disk
//  It contains exactly CACHE1 blocks of size BLOC_SIZE
//  defined as 1024 (as of 1-8) in disk_.h
//  Very big objects are spread on several blocs but must be read
//  in a single call, therefore CACHE1 must be big enough to
//  accomodate the largest object (most probably Voc[_VText])
//
//  Cache2 contains the develloped image of the B objects.
//  It is handled as a shared memory between the various pieces of
//  the code accessing the objects and keeps a count of the handles.
//  If the total size of the of objects exceeds CACHE2, it will destroy the
//  unreferenced ones. Hence, if you loop on bsCreate() and never 
//  bsDestroy, cache2 extends until you run out of memory.
//  Even if CACHE2 is very small, the code will allways run, just
//  much slower, since you will more often have to access cache1 
//  and possibly the disk.


CACHE1 = 16000     // Size of first cache, as used in w5/blocksubs.c
CACHE2 = 32000     // Size of second cache, as used in w5/objcache.c
DISK =  4000     // Initial size of database on disk at creation

//  end of the cachesize.wrm file
