Heidelberg 20.11.92

Prototype RPC mechanism for a reliable client/server connection.
Designed by Petr Kocab and Otto Ritter, DKFZ Heidelberg.
Implemented by Petr Kocab [ dok416@cvx12.dkfz-heidelberg.de ].

Abstract
--------
The client process uses the function ace_server_call(...) to
transfer a data structure to the server process where a call_back
function is called, and it returns the output data which are
passed back to the ace_server_call(...). The client waits for
this or for timeout. The server may run in the background or as
a daemon, and it waits using the system call of select() - therefore
no unnecessary CPU consumption.

In the exapmle, the client "cnace" passes a simple text message
to the server, "snace", who changes all characters into uppercase
and returns back the modified message. We've tested messages of
up to 2MB length. The 'transmission rate' between Heidelberg and
London was practically the same as for FTP.

For binary data the XDR encoding should be used if the client and 
server have different byte order representations.

Refer to the nace_com.h file for function prototypes and
descriptions.

Directory contents
------------------
nace.x			the source for rpcgen which defines 
			the basic data structures and 
			RPC's constants
nace.h                  output from rpcgen
nace_clnt.c             output from rpcgen
nace_svc.c              output from rpcgen
nace_xdr.c              output from rpcgen
nace_com.h		include file for client and server processes
nace_cp.c		source file with client's functions
nace_sp.c		source file with server's functions
snace.c			very simple server (example)
cnace.c		 	very simple client (example)
  
Note: nace.h, nace_clnt.c, nace_svc.c and nace_xdr.c are not
      modified anyhow ( they come out of rpcgen )

      nace is a shortcut for "net ace"

How to build the client / server :
--------------------------------
1)  rpcgen nace.x
2)  gcc -g -o snace snace.c nace_sp.c nace_xdr.c
3)  gcc -g -o cnace cnace.c nace_cp.c nace_clnt.c nace_xdr.c

Known bugs :
----------
1)  I had to use gcc version 2.3.1 !  With my previous version (I think 1.4)
    I had problems during runnig a client.
2)  When the client's RPC function finishes with a timeout error, 
    the server occassionally crashes. More research into RPC has to be done.
