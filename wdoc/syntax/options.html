<h2>AceDB options.wrm syntax</h2>

<p>This file is read only at execution time</p>

<p>It holds the class definitions necessary to the applications.
The kernel classes are defined in the program code.</p>

<p>You can freely edit this file without recompiling
but it must remain consistent with the other wspec files
and you must never change the type (A, B, X) of a class
unless you reconstruct the database from ace files.</p>

<p>Line starting with _VClassName are parsed, they are expected
to contain a la Unix a set of -Option parameters.
Class names must match their enumeration in wspec/classes.wrm</p>

<p>The order in which classes appear here will be used in displays.</p>

<p>Options names can be abbreviated, recognized options are</p>

<dl>
  <dt>-Hidden    
  <dd>  this class will be listed in the Main Window triangle.
  <dt>-Visible   
  <dd>  this class will be listed in the acedb Main Window.
  <dt>-Array     
  <dd>  this class is of type A, (Array or tuple).
  <dt>-Btree     
  <dd>  this class is of type B, it must be further defined in models.wrm
  <dt>-XREF      
  <dd>  Auto cross referencing Hidden B system class. Do not use.
  <dt>-Display  displayType 
  <dd>  The preferred display type of the class.
  <dt>-Title  Tag 
  <dd>  If present in some object of that class, the text following it
      will be used preferentially when referring to that object.
  <dt>-Symbol Tag 
  <dd>  If present in some object of that class, the text
      or key following it will be used preferentially
      when referring to that object in Maps.
  <dt>-Rename otherName 
  <dd>  Other name will show in lists, old and new
      name will be recognized in ace files and queries, old
      is used in the code. In case some newName
      matches some old name, the new name takes precedence.
  <dt>-CaseSensitive 
  <dd>  The names in this class will be case sensitive.
      Never undo this option once it has been used.
  <dt>-Known 
  <dd>  Prevents indirect creation of new object in ace files
      You can't enter a new object in this class directly
      but not by quoting it in another object.
</dl>

<p>Classes default as -B -H -D TREE
type A classes further default as -H -D ZERO</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Displays
   <dd> Every display type needs a display function.
   <dt> Parsers
   <dd> Special code must be provided for A Classes
   <dt> Dumps
   <dd> Special code must be provided to dump A classes
 </dl>

<p>
These routines must be registered in file wspec/quovadis.h before
recompilation.</p>
