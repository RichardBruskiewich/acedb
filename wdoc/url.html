A Guide To Using URLs in ACEDB

<H2>Richard Durbins description of the current system</H2>

<pre>There is in fact a standard acedb way to put URLs into acedb, which I
guess Arnthor has found since he says it works for him.  This is not a
specific class, but rather a display type.  It's behaviour is
potentially quite complex, though it is easy to do the standard simple
things.

I think it is worth describing the full behaviour because it might be
good to reimplement it in AceBrowser for consistency.  The original code
is in doWWWDisplay() in display.c.

1) If the object contains the tag "Url" then use the following text as
   the URL (that's the easy case!).

Else if the object contains the tag "Web_location" followed by <key>
then we expect that the object corresponding to <key> contains template
information that will tell you how to construct the URL from the
original object.  The principle is that first you find some base text,
then apply some rewriting rules.  This allows many objects to share one
URL construction template.

First to get the base text:

2) If the tag "Reference_tag" occurs in the template followed by some
   text, then assume that text is a tag name, and look for the base text
   to follow this tag in the original object.  There is some code that
   allows this to be done in a class-specific way, so that e.g.

     Reference_tag Foo Sequence
                   Bar Clone

   would use the Foo tag when this template is applied to Sequence
   objects and the Bar tag when applied to Clones.  The default if just

     Reference_tag Foo

   is to look following Foo in the original object independent of class.

3) If (2) gave nothing, and the tag "Use_name" is found in the template,
   then use the name of the original object.  This too can be class
   qualified, so that

     Use_name Locus
              Allele

   would mean that this template only uses gets the base text from the
   name for the Locus and Allele classes.  Again, the default if the tag
   "Use_name" is not followed by anything is to use the name for the
   base text whatever is being displayed.


4) Next protect unclean URL characters.

5) Next if the tag "Rewrite" exists in the template, then apply the
   first of the rewrite rules that matches and display.  Else just
   display the base text.  Rewrite rules are given via

     Rewrite &lt;new prefix&gt; &lt;new suffix&gt; [&lt;old prefix&gt; [&lt;old suffix&gt;]]

   if an old prefix and/or suffix is given, then it is required to match
   to that for the rule to apply.  If there is a match, then these are
   deleted.  Following which, the new prefix and suffix are pre- and
   post-pended.

Example:

  Protein SP:P15501
  Web_location Expasy

  URL_template Expasy
  Use_name
  Rewrite http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/niceprot.pl? "" SP:

would, if Protein SP:P15501 were displayed with display method WWW,
generate the URL "http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/niceprot.pl?P15501"

Note that you would think that the absolute default behaviour if neither
Url nor Web_location is given in the original object would be to use the
name of the object as the URL.  That doesn't seem to be the case.
Shouldn't it be, Simon?

<H2>Lincoln Steins comments</H2>

<pre>Richard,

Thanks for the information.  This sounds a bit hairy, but I
think I can code it.  It's a little more difficult to assign
special behaviors to tags (and combinations) of tags, than to
specific classes, and I'm going to have to do a bit of client
side caching of the templates in order to avoid a double-trip
to the server for each URL displayed.

Any reason you didn't do it like this?

        Url ?Url_template text

where text is the variant part of the Url?  Then the rewrite
rule could just contain a placeholder for the substitution,
such as http://foo.bar/cgi-bin?lookup=%1

I notice that the C elegans models.wrm has two URL things:

?Url    Url UNIQUE Text // Simple, text of URL
        Template UNIQUE ?Url // use this object as a generic template
        Reference_tag UNIQUE Text // look for this tag in the reffing object for url
        Remove_prefix UNIQUE Text // prefix to remove to make url
        Remove_postfix UNIQUE Text // postfix to remove to make url
        Prepend UNIQUE Text // then add this to the beginning
        Append UNIQUE Text // then add this to the end
        Web_location UNIQUE ?WWW_server

?WWW_server     Url UNIQUE Text // Simple, text of URL  
                Use_name Text // (optional) Classname
                Rewrite Text UNIQUE Text Text UNIQUE Text 
                Reference_tag UNIQUE Text // look for this tag in the reffing object for
url



While RiceGenes (and many of the other agro databases) do something else:

?Database       Name Text // Full name
                Contents ?Text // Description of material included
                WWW     Arg1_URL_prefix UNIQUE Text
                        Arg1_URL_suffix UNIQUE Text
                        Arg2_URL_prefix UNIQUE Text
                        Arg2_URL_suffix UNIQUE Text

I guess this has been through a number of iterations.  Should I contact
Sam Cartinhour, Dave Matthews and the UK Cropnet folk and poll them on
whether they are dependent on any particular version of the URL model?
