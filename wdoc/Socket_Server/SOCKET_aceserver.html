User Guide To Sockets-based Client/Server
</H1>

<ADDRESS>Originally written by<BR>
Ed Griffiths &lt;edgrif@sanger.ac.uk&gt;, December 1999</ADDRESS>

</DIV>

<H2>Background</H2>

<P>The first implementation of the ACEDB client/server code used <CODE>RPC</CODE> for
inter process communication (<CODE>IPC</CODE>). This method was originally
chosen because it offered the promise and portable means of making requests
between the client and server. In practice <CODE>RPC</CODE> suffered from
several major disadvantages:
<UL>
  <LI>although <CODE>RPC</CODE> was offered by all major unix vendors, their
       implementations turned out to be buggy, in different ways (ironically,
       this was especially true of Suns implementation).
  <LI>although <CODE>RPC</CODE> offers a very simple function call interface
       for <CODE>IPC</CODE>, error handling is not so simple and does not
       offer the fine grained control that other methods of <CODE>IPC</CODE> do.
  <LI><CODE>RPC</CODE> for MS Windows is not robust.
  <LI><CODE>DCE RPC</CODE> using the DCE version of RPC would help with portability for
       both Unix and MS Windows, but the DCE version is often not available for free.
  <LI>many other code subsytems offer sockets communication (e.g. Perl) but not
       <CODE>RPC</CODE>.
  <LI>On unix at least  <CODE>RPC</CODE> requires several daemons to be running (portmapper,
       inetd) and this makes the system susceptible to system set up/reboot problems.
</UL>
The decision was taken to switch to socket based <CODE>IPC</CODE> because it overcomes
the above difficulties. Sockets of course present their own difficulties because the interface
to them is more complex to program than <CODE>RPC</CODE>, it's greater flexibility/portability
and ubiquitousness made this a worthwhile trade off.



<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The sockets based version of the server offers the same interface as the current RPC based
version of the client/server but there have been several additions to the code that are
either indirectly or not directly related to sockets:

<UL>
  <LI>NO_RESTART option & fix for the "phoenix" bug
  <LI>READ/WRITE options for setting global access permissions to a database
  <LI>MD5 password based authentification for users
  <LI>domain name group authorisation (NO_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION option)
  <LI>a new "admin" class of user with a set of "admin" commands
  <li>READ ONLY database support
  <LI>DEBUG option
</UL>

<P>This document describes these new features and then goes on to describe how to:

<UL>
  <LI>set up a database for use with the sockets server
  <LI>server start up options
  <LI>foreground and inetd startup of the server
  <LI>client start up  
</UL>



<H2>Setting up a database</H2>

<P>The following is a brief summary to get you started, it should 
let you get the server/client going, after that you can tinker around
to get more security etc.:

<H3>1) Options in wspec/serverconfig.wrm:</H3>
<DL>
  <DT><B>NO_RESTART</B>
  <DD>- turns ON no restart of server after a crash/shutdown.
  <DT><B>NO_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION</B>
  <DD>- turns OFF checking for user being in a domain specified
       as having permission to log in, e.g.  sanger.ac.uk
  <DT><B>DEBUG</B>
  <DD>- turns ON server debugging output to database/server.log
  <DT><B>WRITE/READ</B>
  <DD>- set the basic database access permission levels for the
       read and write groups (admin users always have write access).
       Default is PASSWD, but NONE & WORLD can also be set.
  <dt><B>READONLY_DATABASE</B>
  <dd>- allows the server to run on a database where all the file permissions
      have been set to read-only (unix only) for extra security.
</DL>
     
<P>Unless you have special needs, the default settings are suitable for
either testing or a production database, but you must create the empty file
<b>wspec/serverconfig.wrm</b>.

<P>See <A HREF="#config_options">Configuration options</A> for more details.


<H3>2) Passwords in wspec/serverpasswd.wrm:</H3>

<P>This file contains two types of record: groups/associated users
records and individual user records. There are three groups: admin, write and read
and to set up a database to run with the new socket server there needs
to be <B>at least one user</B> in the admin group.

<P>To 'bootstrap' an admin
user so you can access the database via the client you need to:
<OL>
  <LI>choose your admin userid (this does _not_ need to be an existing
       Unix userid, it can be any name you want), e.g. <B>joebloggs</B>
  <LI>alter the admin group line in <CODE><B>serverpasswd.wrm</B></CODE> so it looks like
       this:
       <PRE><CODE><B>
       admin: joebloggs</B></CODE>
       </B></CODE></PRE>
  <LI>now use the acedb utility program makeUserPasswd to create the
       user entry for joebloggs (note that you won't see the password
       you type):
       <PRE><CODE>
       > bin.<i>whatever</i>/makeUserPasswd joebloggs
       // Please enter passwd: jumbo10
       // Please re-enter passwd: jumbo10
       // The following line is a valid entry for wspec/serverpasswd.wrm
       
       joebloggs ccc5b9abf592836076410cdee518c518
       
       > 
       </CODE></PRE>
       <P>cut and paste the entry into a separate line in the <CODE><B>serverpasswd.wrm</B></CODE> file.
</OL>

<p>The resulting <b>wspec/serverpasswd.wrm</b> file would look like this:
       <PRE><CODE><B>
       admin: joebloggs
       joebloggs ccc5b9abf592836076410cdee518c518
       </B></CODE></PRE>

<P>Once the initial admin user has been set up, all other users can
be set up from the admin userid via the new admin commands.

<P>You should now be in a position to test the server and client, it is
recommended that you test the server in the foreground before trying
to set it up to be run by inetd.


<H2>Server start up options</H2>

<P>saceserver command line options are:
<PRE><CODE>
saceserver database_path &lt:port_number clientT:serverT:maxReq:autoS&gt;

           <B>database_path</B>    mandatory, gives path to the database
             <B>port_number</B>    defaults to 23100
                 <B>clientT</B>    client time out (secs), default = 600
                 <B>serverT</B>    server time out (secs), default = 600
                  <B>maxReply</B>  maximum reply size (Kbytes) that server should return
                   <B>autoS</B>    time between autosaves of database (secs), default = 600
</CODE></PRE>


<H3>timeout values</H3>

<P>The meaning of the timeouts is:
<dl>
  <dt><B>clientT</B>
  <dd>the server will disconnect any clients who have not been active for this length of time.
  <dt><B>serverT</B>
  <dd>once all clients are disconnected, the server will timeout after this length of time. 
</dl>

<P>So if, for instance, you wanted to allow clients to be dormant for an hour
but have the server close down as soon as the last client quit you could start
the server like this:

<pre><code>saceserver your_database_path your_port 3600:1
</code></pre>

<P>Note that clientT and serverT can take the special value zero which means
the timeout is infinite, i.e. neither the client or server will ever be timed
out. This special value is provided for testing and is specifically <B>not</B>
recommended for normal use.


<H3>maximum request size</H3>

<P>The meaning of the maximum request field is:
<dl>
  <dt><B>maxReply</B>
  <dd>If the reply to a client exceeds this threshold then the server "slices" the reply up
      and returns it a piece at a time. This prevents a single client from hogging the server.
</dl>

<P>Note that maxReply can take the special value zero which means
that there is no maximum reply threshold and the server will return in one piece the
entire reply. This special value is provided for circumstances where the user wants to get
large replies back in one piece, you should note that other clients requests will not be
processed while a large reply is being sent.


<H3>port numbers</H3>


<P>IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has set aside certain ranges of port
numbers for certain uses:

<PRE><CODE>

Port No. range          Usage
--------------          -----

0 - 1023                "well-known" ports, you need super user authority
                        to use these and they are reserved for ftp, http,
                        X windows and basic operating system services.
                        <b>DO NOT USE THESE</b>.

1024 - 49151            "registered" ports, if you setting up the server to
                        be run by inetd you should use one of these.
                        <B>But</B> you will need to check in /etc/services
                        that your number does not clash with one already there.

49152 - 65535           "dynamic" ports, are for dynamically assigned/ephemeral
                        use. You should use one of these if you are just trying
                        out the server from an xterm in the foreground.

</CODE></PRE>

<P>Actually its all more confused than this, not all operating systems stick to
the IANA recommendations, but it is
generally true that you cannot use a port less then 1024 without root permission
and you should not in general choose these ports.

<P>You should also <b>not</b> choose a port larger than 65535. If you do, the port
number may be truncated in a way that leaves it in the range 0 - 1023 which are
reserved for superuser use for well-known services.

<P>Typically you will see these sorts of errors if you choose a port that is
either below 1024 or already in use (you may have to look in the database
logfile to see the error if the server is inetd started):

<PRE><CODE>

<B>typical server error:</B>

% saceserver /mydatabase 777
// Database directory: /data1/GrainGenes
// #### Server starts 2000-04-03_11:29:49   
// #### host=(unknown)  port=777  ACEDB=/data1/GrainGenes
// #### clientTimeout=600 serverTimeout=600 maxKbytes=0 autoSaveInterval=600
 
// FATAL ERROR (www on gn) reported by program aceserver (ACEDB 4_9c), in file a
cesocket.c, at line 657: Cannot bind to server listening socket system error 13
 - Permission denied
// Sorry for the crash, please report it, if it is reproducible

// NB: changes made since the last explicit save have NOT been saved


<B>typical client error:</B>

% saceclient localhost -port 777
FATAL ERROR (www on gn) reported by program saceclient (ACEDB 4_9c), in file ace
socketlib.c, at line 269: connect error system error 146 - Connection refused

</CODE></PRE>



<H2>Running the Server</H2>

<H3>in the foreground</H3>

<P>To run the server in the foreground, type the following at the prompt in an xterm:

<pre><code>  saceserver &lt;your/data/base&gt;  &lt;your_port_number&gt; &lt;time_out_options&gt;
</code></pre>

<P>If the server starts correctly your xterm will "hang" because the server will be sitting
waiting for clients to connect. If something goes wrong acedb will print an error message and
then exit. You should correct the error and then try again.

<P>Once the server is starting correctly then try accessing it using the client:

<pre><code>saceclient &lt;host_where_server_is_running&gt; -port &lt;port_number_from_above&gt;
acedb&gt; status
acedb&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<P>If you can connect correctly then you are ready to try running the server under the control
of one of the unix <A HREF="#inetd">inetd</A>
or <A HREF="#xinetd">xinetd</A> controller programs.



<a name="inetd"><H3>under inetd</H3>

<P>You can now run saceserver against any existing acedb database
and/or register it under inetd by adding lines to the following
files (you will need root access):

<P>For this example we assume:

<PRE>nickname for server/database -  MyfirstDB
             port for server -  20113
        user owning database -  mieg
       path to server binary -  /usr/local/bin/saceserver
            path to database -  /home/databases/aardvarkDB
   timeout values for server -  200:200:0
</PRE>


<P><b>In /etc/services add the line:</b>

<pre><code>MyfirstDB  20113/tcp
</code></pre>


<P><b>in /etc/inetd.conf add the line</b>

<pre><code>MyfirstDB stream tcp wait mieg  /usr/local/bin/saceserver saceserver /home/databases/aardvarkDB 200:200:0
</code></pre>

<P>Where:

<pre><code>                <b>MyfirstDB</b>  seen in both files, a random name of your choice to name the database server
          <b>stream tcp wait</b>  mandatory, this is the way the daemon must be declared
                     <b>mieg</b>  user name under which the daemon runs, avoid root,
                           choose some local user owning /home/databases/aardvarkDB
<b>/usr/local/bin/saceserver</b>  full path to saceserver executable
               <b>saceserver</b>  repeat the name of the execuatble so that it is found as argv[0] by the code
 <b>/home/databases/aardvark</b>  the database directory
                <b>200:200:0</b>  server and client time out in seconds, then a blocking factor
                           (default zero is ok)
</code></pre>


<P>Now get inetd to reread /etc/inetd.conf and pick up the information for MyfirstDB
(you will probably need to be root to do this):

<ol>
  <li>find out the process id of inetd
<pre>&gt; ps -A | grep inetd

   545 ??       I        0:00.62 /usr/sbin/inetd
</pre>

  <li>Send inetd the interrupt signal
<pre>&gt; kill -HUP 545
</pre>
</ol>


<P>Sending this signal should be enough but on some old systems a reboot may be necessary.

<P>Then access the server by starting up a client:

<pre><code>saceclient &lt;host_where_server_is_running&gt; -port 20113
</code></pre>


<a name="xinetd"><H3>under xinetd</H3>

<P>xinetd is an open source replacement for inetd, it provides many more features and much
security than inetd, you can read more about it at the
<A HREF="http://www.xinetd.org/">xinetd website</A>.

<P>Its configuration is a bit different from inetd and is as follows:

<P>For this example we assume the following:

<PRE>nickname for server/database -  MyfirstDB
             port for server -  20113
        user owning database -  mieg
       path to server binary -  /usr/local/bin/saceserver
            path to database -  /home/databases/aardvarkDB
   timeout values for server -  200:200:0
</PRE>


<P>In <b>/etc/services</b> add the line:

<pre><code>MyfirstDB  20113/tcp
</code></pre>


<P>xinetd keeps its configuration files in the directory <b>/etc/xinetd.d</b>. Create a file
in this directory giving it some meaningful name such as <b>acedb</b> and add the
following lines:

<pre><code># file: /etc/xinetd.d/acedb
# default: on
# description: wormbase acedb database
service acedb
{
               protocol                = tcp
               socket_type             = stream
               port                    = 20113
               flags                   = REUSE
               wait                    = yes
               user                    = mieg
               group                   = mieg
               log_on_success          += USERID DURATION
               log_on_failure          += USERID HOST
               server                  = /usr/local/bin/saceserver
               server_args             = /home/databases/aardvarkDB 200:200:0
}
</code></pre>

<P>Note that you will need to change the port, user, group, server and server_args
fields for you setup.

<P><b>Warning:</b> In the past there have been a number of problems with the way
xinetd worked which prevented users from running the acedb servers with xinetd.
Currently the following combination of Linux, xinetd and acedb is known to work:

<P><b>Linux:</b> Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla), kernal: 2.4.18-27.7.xbigmem

<P><b>xinetd:</b> xinetd-2.3.7-4.7x

<P><b>acedb:</b> 4_9m

<P>If you find that you cannot get acedb working under xinetd control then you should
first check that you have up to date software.


<H2>Running the client</H2>
<PRE>

Usage: saceclient &lt;host&gt; [-port pn] [-time_out <nn>] [-ace_out] [-ace_in] [-f file_name parms]

host: is a machine where the server runs or is a registered service.
pn: is the port number described in the server setup section.
nn: is a number of seconds to wait to receive a server answer, it defaults to 300.
-ace_out: implies a clean output: .ace files or clean tables
-ace_in: if the input to the client is an ace file to be parsed by the server.
-f filename: say for mailing, a command file which is echoed on stdout except
 that %1 %2 ... %9 will be macro substituted by the parms parameters and
 that the construction %(xxx) where xxx is a client command will be evaluated

</PRE>


<H2>Introduction of MD5 password encryption based authentification for users</H2>

<P>The sockets based version comes with a new password based system. The previous
versions of the server used a file based system that while not requiring
users to user passwords, did require that both client and server could
"see" the directory where the "magic" files used by the server for
authentification were stored. This has obvious problems when the client and
server are separated by a firewall, are very remote from each other or either
is running on a system that does not support shared file systems.

<P>The new system uses passwords much like any Unix system does, users have their
own unique userid and must supply a password to gain access to the database.
Note that userids are 'global' to a database, e.g. if two users on different machines
by chance have the same userid, they cannot both use that userid to gain access to
the database, one or the other will have to use a different userid for the database.
This is the same restriction as applies to Unix login ids.

<P>The new system uses a "challenge-response" protocol: the client contacts the
server, the server sends the client a key, the client must then encrypt their
userid, password and the key and send it back to ther server. The server then
encrypts its copy of the encrypted userid/password with the key and compares
them with what its been sent. At no time does the password pass in plain text
across the network, nor is it stored in plain text. Furthermore, they key
is changed every time the user logs on, making it more difficult to crack
the password. While not perfect this method offers at least as much (actually
more) security than the Unix password system. This is also essentially the
method of security used in the http protocol.

<P>There is a new file, <CODE>wspec/serverpasswd.wrm</CODE>, which holds
the userids and associated passwords and also which group a userid belongs
to. There are three groups of users:
<DL>
  <DT>read
  <DD>users who can get read access to the database
  <DT>write
  <DD>users who can get read/write access to the database
  <DT>admin
  <DD>users who can get read/write access to the database and run
       administrative commands on the database (e.g. add new users, shutdown
       the database etc.)
</DL>

<P>Entries in this file are of two sorts: group entries and userid entries, below is
a sample <CODE>wspec/serverpasswd.wrm</CODE> showing both group and userid
entries (as usual lines beginning with "//" are comments):
<PRE>
// User groups
//
admin:  edgrif
write: simon
read: jean richard sanger.ac.uk

// users and passwords
//
edgrif 38a6557860893d95c7e738c0e5cd233d
simon 7d61c0b3fb23c97f6970f07683a03649
jean 52af4f5526e16c855ca14a40287d1be1
richard 9dee3b01e9adeb11f8acac16fb368d76
</PRE>

<P>Initially an admin user must create a new entry for a user, complete with password (see
admin user section), after this a user can change their own password using the
<CODE>passwd</CODE> command from the saceclient:
<PRE><TERM>
acedb> passwd
enter new passwd:
reenter new passwd:
</TERM></PRE>
Only rudimentary password checking is done, it is up to users/administrators to ensure
that good passwords are chosen.




<H2>Introduction of domain name group authorisation and the NO_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION option</H2>

<P>The previous section described the format of entries in  <CODE>wspec/serverpasswd.wrm</CODE>,
the "read" and "write" group entries can also contain domain names:

<PRE>
// User groups
//
admin:  edgrif
write: simon
read: jean richard sanger.ac.uk
</PRE>

<P>The "read" group entry contains the entry "sanger.ac.uk", this allows any user whose
internet address ends with this sub-domain to log in with read access, e.g.
johnsmith@linuxbox.sanger.ac.uk, janebrown@sanger.ac.uk etc. This makes it
possible to give access to groups of people logging in from different sites. This only
happens if the access level for a group is <CODE>PASSWD</CODE> and the userid of the
connecting client cannot be found in the group.

<P>When a client connects, the server only has the numeric version of the clients
internet address, since the lookup required to convert this to the text form
can be both error prone and slow, it is possible to globally disable this lookup
by setting the <CODE>NO_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION</CODE> option in <CODE>wspec/serverconfig.wrm</CODE>.
If this option is set, the server will not attempt to resolve the text form of a clients
internet address and match it to group name entries.



<H2>Introduction of an "admin" class of user and a set of "admin" commands</H2>

<P>The introduction of a password system made it necessary to introduce some
extra commands to the command line interface: because users passwords are
relatively long and must be copied into the password file correctly, this is
only really feasible via a program. It also became clear that there should
be a special class of user who would be allowed to run these commands and not
just any user with write access as in previous servers.

<P>Some "admin" commands already existed e.g. shutdown, these commands have
been supplemented with additional commands including:
<DL>
  <DT><B>shutdown [now] [norestart]</B>
  <DD>Shuts down the server, by default this is when the last client quits but
       if the <B>now</B> option is specified, clients connections are terminated
       immediately and the server is shut down. If the  <B>norestart</B> is specified
       then the server will not restart until the lock file
       <CODE>database/SERVER_SHUTDOWN_LOCKFILE.wrm</CODE> is removed.
  <DT><B>who</B>
  <DD>display how many clients are currently connected.
  <DT><B>data_version</B>
  <DD>data served now, as stated in wspec/server.wrm
  <DT><B>wspec</B>
  <DD>export wspec directory as a tar file
  <DT><B>user passwd|group|new|delete <I>userid [password group]</I></B>
  <DD>This command has several forms enabling an admin user to create/update/delete userids:
       <UL>
	 <LI>Create: <B>user new <I>new_userid new_group</I></B> (you will be prompted for the passwd)
	 <LI>Delete: <B>user delete <I>userid</I></B>
	 <LI>Change group: <B>user group <I>userid new_group</I></B>
	 <LI>Change password: <B>user passwd <I>userid</I></B> (you will be prompted for the passwd)
       </UL>

<a name="config_options"></a><H2>Server Configuration Options</H2>


<H4>NO_RESTART (and the "phoenix" bug)</H4>

<P>This option can be specified in <CODE>wspec/serverconfig.wrm</CODE> and will prevent the
database from restarting after either a controlled shutdown or
a server crash. If the option is specified then the server will
leave a lockfile in the <CODE>database/</CODE> on shutdown or when it crashes
(either in a trappable or non-trappable way).
The name of the lockfile
indicates whether the file was written as a result of a crash
or a shutdown:
<PRE>
For a crash that was detected by the acedb code:

database/SERVER_CRASH_LOCKFILE.wrm

for a crash that could not be detected by the acedb code:

database/SERVER_UNDETECTABLECRASH_LOCKFILE.wrm

and for a shutdown:

database/SERVER_SHUTDOWN_LOCKFILE.wrm
</PRE>

<P>The server cannot be restarted either manually or automatically by inetd until
the lockfile is removed from the directory (the directory would normally be set up
so that only admin users would have permission to do this).

<P>Previous acedb servers have suffered from an irritating bug when run under the control
of inetd. This bug (aka the "phoenix" bug) seemed to occur sometimes when the server
crashed, the system would get into a loop with the server crashing, inetd respawning the server,
the server crashing, inetd respawning the server, etc. etc. The advantage of the socket based
server is that the greater degree of control over the port allowed debugging to show that this
happens when a client has connected, but the server crashes <B>before</B> it has cleared the
listening socket on which the client connected. In this case, inetd finds that there is still
data on the listening socket and so it restarts the server which of course crashes again before
clearing the listening socket. The new server has as part of its crash routine some code to
clear the listening socket and thus put a stop to inetd trying to restart the server. Note
however that this bug can still occur if the server crashes in an untrappable way, this
loophole will be fixed at some time in the future.


<H4>READ/WRITE options for setting global access permissions to a database</H4>

<P>The <CODE>READ</CODE> and <CODE>WRITE</CODE> options can be specified in
<CODE>wspec/serverconfig.wrm</CODE> and allow 'global' control of the access level
for all users in the read or write groups.

<P>Three levels of control are available:
<DL>
  <DT>WORLD
  <DD>any user can have access, including users not specified in <CODE>wspec/serverpasswd.wrm</CODE>
  <DT>PASSWD
  <DD>only users specified in <CODE>wspec/serverpasswd.wrm</CODE> can gain access (with a password)
  <DT>NONE
  <DD>no users can have access
</DL>

<P>The access level is specified on the same line as the keywords <CODE>READ</CODE> or
<CODE>WRITE</CODE>, e.g. to give read access to everyone and write access to no one,
<CODE>wspec/serverconfig.wrm</CODE> should contain the lines:
<PRE>
READ WORLD
WRITE NONE
</PRE>

<P>Admin group users always have write access to the database but this access is via a password.



<H4>READONLY_DATABASE option</H4>

<P>Normally the server must have read/write access to at least some of the files
and directories within an acedb database (e.g. for logging). This option allows
the server to run on a database where it only has read permission for <b>all</b>
directories and files within the database. This can be useful as extra level of security
for a database which has been made available as a "read only" copy, perhaps to
any user anywhere on the internet.

<p>You should note that when this option is specified, the server will not do
any logging of requests or crashes, so there will be <b>no</b> record of users
interactions with the server.


<H4>DEBUG option</H4>

<P>This option can be specified in <CODE>wspec/serverconfig.wrm</CODE> and will cause the server
to send debugging output to <CODE>database/server.log</CODE>, if the server is being run
in the foreground then the output will also be sent to stderr. Currently this information
is patchy but this release of the server includes the basic mechanism (setting up callback
routines for the messout/messerror routines) for easy output of debugging messages which
was missing in previous servers.
