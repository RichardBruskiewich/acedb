This is the AceDB distribution directory.  The current release of the
AceDB code is version 4_9.  This directory should contain at least

README			This file.
NOTES			Further notes - please get and read this file unless
				you know exactly what you want to do.
INSTALL			The installation script - get a new copy of this when 
				getting updates or a new release
ACEDB-NNN.tar.gz	Archives for download of binaries, docs, help, source,
				 tools.

You should read the NOTES file for descriptions of the various download
files.

Further information about AceDB can be obtained from:

	- the bionet newsgroup bionet.software.acedb
	- the AceDB web site http://www.acedb/org/

**********************************************************************
AceDB 4.9 is fully compatible with 4.7 & 4.8

But when you install the new code, you should read-models
from xace or from tace to benefit from the new fuller indexing.

If you want to compile your own binaries then you should read the
paragraphs about the incorporation of GNU software libraries into
AceDB in the file NOTES mentioned above. In particular, the first time
you do a build you will need to have read these notes.
