<h2>New FIND functionality in TreeDisplay.</h2>

<p>
Starting with release 4_9r, the old "Find Tag" or even older "Warp to Tag" function has
been replaced by a new, more generic "Find" which locates any object you specify, whether
a tag or not.
</p>
<p>
As with previous versions, you use the right mouse button to drop down the menu, from
which you can choose Find.  However, the new version also responds to Control/F to
initiate a forward search and Control/B for a reverse direction search.  The reverse
search starts at the distal end of the tree and works backwards, of course. In all cases,
the same dialogue box appears for you to enter the text you want.
</p>
<p>
For performance reasons, only the expanded portion of the tree is searched.  Unfolding
each node, searching it and folding it away was considered too costly to be worth
implementing, and users we consulted said that in general they know the location of
the objects their seeking well enough to unfold the necessary nodes manually.
</p><p>
If the object can't be found, you get an error message. 
</p>
<p>
Once it has been located, you can get to the next and previous occurrences of your text
using Control/. and Control/, buttons.  I originally wanted to use Control/N and Control/P
but the latter was already in use for printing, and I thought the appearance of the chevron
keys was in keeping with the function, though I've not insisted you also press Shift to get
there.
</p>
<p>
When you reach the end/beginning of the tree, you get a warning message, after which
a further Next/Prev wraps the search back to the point at which it started.
</p>
<p>
Control/F and Control/B always give you back the Find dialogue box to allow you to change
the object you're looking for, but note that it will start from the top of the tree rather
than your current position if you do so.
</p>
<p>
Find also works in the UpdateTree display.
</p>
<h2>New HotKeys</h2>
In the TreeDisplay, you can shift directly to the UpdateTree using Control/U and
then you can get back to the TreeDisplay using Control/T in UpdateTree.
</p><p>
I've also added Control/U to UpdateTree to save your work.  This doesn't actually write
the changes back to disc, but it does save them in the cache, so when you exit the window
they're not lost, ie the same as the menu Save function.  Also as with the Save
function on the menu, you're automatically returned
to the TreeDisplay after using Control/U.

This is quite distinct from the Control/S Save function which exists in the whole of
AceDB.
<p>
Finally, this is old news but not everyone knows it.  If you select a tag in
TreeDisplay and go from there to the UpdateTree display, that tag will be centred on the
screen for you.
