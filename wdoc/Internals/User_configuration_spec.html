<H1>Spec/Design For User Configuration Of Acedb Programs</H1>



<H2>General Configuration</H2>

<H3>Design points</H3>

<P>The following are a heavily randomised series of jottings/issues:

<ul>
  <li>We need database specific configuration files because some settings will
      vary widely between databases, e.g. for FMap the columns (i.e. Method objects)
      may be completely different between different databases.
  <li>Configuration files should be simple text based files that follow the usual
      stanza or .ini files type format.
  <li>Need to remember that resources, while mostly set from and applying to xace,
      may also be relevant to tace or the server, this may raise some implementation
      issues, e.g. sometimes stanzas will need to be read and sometimes need to be
      ignored, e.g. there's no point in the server or tace reading the "FMap" stanza.
  <li>should each stanza need to have a complete list of the configuration for that
      stanza ? Probably, otherwise we have to "know" which bits have been changed
      from the hard coded defaults, probably easiest to save everything. Code
      should probably complain about unknown keywords within stanzas.
</ul>


<H3>File and Directory structure</H3>

<P>The current .acedbrc file should be replaced with a .acedbrc <b>directory</b>.
The version of the code that uses the new directory structure
should check whether .acedbrc is a
file and if it is should refuse to run, issuing an error message to say that the
user needs to run a script to update their defaults.. We should provide a perl script to
convert .acedbrc files to the equivalent directories. Lets keep the actual acedb
code as simple as possible.
<p><strong>NB</strong> The Windows version uses the registry, so will need to be handled differently.</p>
<P>I would envisage something like the following structure:

<P><pre><code>
                     ----------- Common_Defaults.conf
                    |
                    |
                    |----------- C_elegans.conf
     .acedbrc ------|
                    |
                    |----------- lace.conf
                    |
                    |
                     ----------- zebra.conf

</code></pre>

<P>There are essentially two sorts of file here, a common set of defaults
contained in Common_defaults.conf and database specific defaults contained
in other configuration files.

<P>The file Common_Defaults.conf would hold a set of defaults that would always be
applied to xace when it starts up, but if the database was one that equated to
"lace" for example, then defaults from lace.conf would override the common defaults.

<P>(Note that our perl script to migrate users existing .acedbrc file to the .acedbrc
directory would put the existing defaults into Common_Defaults.conf.)

<P>It would probably be simplest to derive the names for the database specific defaults files
directly from the database itself. The most obvious text in the database to use
would be that given by the "NAME" keyword in wspec/database.wrm, this is much more
constant than that given by the "TITLE" keyword. In general users tend to keep "NAME"
constant while changing "TITLE" with each new release of their database. Here are the
descriptions:

<P><pre><code>
// NAME is database name, this is set in the database super block when the database
//   is rebuilt. It can only be changed by rebuilding the database and can be used
//   as a reliable identifier for the database. This name is used in the main window
//   header and in status output.
//
// TITLE is an additional database name that is reread each time the database is
//   restarted. It can be used to give a more temporary title to a database to give
//   more information about the database. This title is used in the main window
//   and will override the main window title in wspec/displays.wrm, its also used in
//   the status output.
</code></pre>

<P>One can imagine a really fancy system of configuration files that used both of the
above but this seems overkill.

<P>One point I haven't thought through: should we allow a configuration file to
be stored in the wspec directory of the database itself ? This would allow the
database administrator to supply some useful defaults with their database and save
the user the trouble of setting up their own. I think this would be a worthwhile
addition. Note that in the sequence of reading defaults, the users own configuration
file for a particular database should take preference over the one stored in the
database. This all works if we have a strict order of reading defaults along
the lines of:

<P><pre><code>
                    defaults set in the code
                                |
                                V
                   .acedbrc/Common_defaults.conf
                                |
                                V
            defaults in &lt;user_database&gt;/wspec/database.conf
                                |
                                V
                 .acedbrc/&lt;user_database_NAME&gt;.conf

</code></pre>

<P>This design of having multiple "layers" of defaults with each successive one
overriding or augmenting the defaults of the previous one is a tried and trusted
way of doing things in the XWindows/Xt world and one I think its worth us copying.


<H3>File format</H3>

<P>Should be a stanza per resource section of acedb, sections will probably
be something like "Tree Display", "FMap display" etc. The precise format would
probably be pretty much like that used in many unix utilities, here is an example
from xinetd (the file is /etc/xinetd.d/chargen):

<pre><code>
# default: off
# description: An xinetd internal service which generate characters. \
# The xinetd internal service which continuously generates characters \
# until the connection is dropped.  The characters look something like this: \
#   !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefg \
# This is the tcp version.

service chargen
{
	type		= INTERNAL
	id		= chargen-stream
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	user		= root
	wait		= no
	disable		= yes
}                                                                               
</code></pre>

<P>Worth noting are the "#" for comments, acedb uses "//" so perhaps we should
continue with that, whichever we do we must allow comments. Also note the
stanza format with a stanza type, "service" and a stanza name, "chargen".
Inside the stanza everything is a "keyword = value" pair.

<P>We probably wouldn't have many stanza "type"s, but its probably worth
having a "type" and a "name" as it allows greater flexibility and it may make it
easier to parse for instance only non-"graphic" stanzas and so on.

<P>An abbreviated (and fictious) example file for acedb might contain:

<pre><code>
// File generated by  Acedb 4_9q xace  on  <timestamp>
// File last updated by  Acedb 4_9s tace  on  <timestamp>
//
// Warning: this file is automatically generated and maintained by Acedb code,
//          do not hand edit.
//

all startup
{
      banner = no
      splash_screen = no
}

graphic Key
{
      auto_display_of_single_key = no           // I've wanted to add this for ages !
}

graphic FMap
{
      columns = RNAi genefinder ....long list of column names
      initial_zoom = 0.5
}                                                                               
</code></pre>

<P>We should allow tabs and spaces interchangeably.


<H3>How it would work</H3>

<P>Should stanza reading be lazy or not ? That is, should we try to read all the
stanzas at program startup or as they are needed ? I'm not sure, in some ways lazy
evaluation would be simpler perhaps because there won't be issues about having to store
stanzas in memory until they are needed etc. etc. One to think about.

<P>To start off I think we should allow resource setting only from xace, we shouldn't
worry about providing a command line interface for tace/giface/server. (but note that
the command line programs will be reading the config files). People can always
hand edit the files for now, with guidance !

<P>Hence the following is all talking about xace.

<P>It's very likely that a user would want to be able to set resources both from
the main window and from individual windows, e.g. I may want to set FMap configuration
without having an FMap actually on the screen. This implies that we need some functions
that can be called both from some code attached to the main window and from individual
windows.

<P>The main window would need a new "Set Configuration" menu item which when selected
would popup a submenu containing all the sections (i.e. stanzas) that could be set,
the user would then select one and a GTK "notebook" would appear which allows editting
of those resources.

<P>Each individual window would need a new "Set Configuration" button of menu item that
when selected would display the same GTK "notebook" as would appear from the main window.

<P>The notebook section would need to provide the following buttons at least:
<ul>
  <li>"Cancel" - throw away all <b>unsaved</b> changes, i.e. return to the configuration as it was
      before the user changed any configuration and quit the notebook.
  <li>"Apply" - apply configuration to program but don't save
  <li>"Save" - save the configuration to the appropriate stanza file (NOTE that user
      should be offered the choice of saving to Common_defaults.conf or the database
      specific configuration file <b>IF</b> the latter exist, we shouldn't force users
      to have database specific configuration files).
  <li>"Quit" - quit the notebook but leave in place any changes that have been made
      whether they have been saved or not, should warn the user that changes have not
      been saved yet.
</ul>


<P>Each section of acedb (e.g. FMap) needs to provide at least two routines
(and probably some more !).

<P>The first will be "internal" to that section of acedb
and will be responsible for reading and applying the defaults when that section of
acedb is called, e.g. when an FMap is displayed the Fmap stanza will need to be read. But
note that if the user has already configured fmap, there may be a configuration in memory
(see below).

<P>The second will be "external" in that it will be callable both from the section itself
and from the main window, it will need to do the following:

<ul>
  <li>read its particular stanza from the stanza file(s)
  <li>create a GTK notebook from the settings in the stanza and by doing whatever
      querying is required of the database etc, e.g. for FMap it would need to query
      the names of all Method objects as these are in essence the available columns
      for the FMap display.
  <li>provide callback routines that will be called as the user interacts with the
      notebook, this may need to do things like "Recalculate" the FMap when the user
      clicks the "Apply" button for the FMap resources.
  <li>The function would need to make sure that the configuration is held in memory
      somewhere so it can be retrieved later, e.g. a user may configure fmap without
      an fmap on the screen, then when the fmap starts up it needs access to the configuration
      which may only be in memory because the user has not saved it.
</ul>

<P>When xace starts up it should call a function that sets up a table of callback functions
for each stanza, this doesn't need to be terribly dynamic/sophisticated it can just be a
hard coded table of "stanza_name : callback_function" pairs. This would be used by the main
window code to call the appropriate function for editting each configuration stanza.


<h3>Rob's Notes</h3>
<p>The GTK Notebook widget gives you pages with tabs in typical Windoze style.  For many of the
bits of xace which might need configuration I imagine a single page would be sufficient,
but for fmap, frinstance, we might want several pages.  This means a generic configuration
function would be harder to implement, so we might want one for each part of the display.

Hence the list connecting the area of the display with the function.  Each function
should then be callable from the individual area of the display to which it applies
or from the main xace window.</p>

<p>For fmap columns we might want a scrollable window of check boxes, one for each method.  So (don't
know how practical this is) get all methods from db and populate the window on the cols page.

The other bit, also covered above, is about a globally available config struct, held in
memory, so if the user does some local configuration but doesn't save it, each time she revisits
that area of the display, the configuration in memory is the one that's applied.  Once she
exits and restarts, she'll get whatever's on disk, of course.


<H2>Specific FMap issues</H2>

<H3>READ THIS FIRST !</H3>

<b><P>ROB, all of the following was from earlier thoughts about fmap specifically. Some of it
clashes with the stuff above. I think the below is probably all too complex, I'm
not sure users would really want lots of views per database. I think its likely they would
prefer to have just one view per database which remove much complexity from below. I also
think that storing fmap configuration in the database is a mistake because it would not then
be per user (or not easily at least) !

<P>I think we should take the good bits from below, e.g. the idea of setting up your fmap
as you like it (size, columns etc) and then clicking a single "Save configuration" button
would be a good addition to the way configuration could be done. Anything that no longer
seems relevant we should junk.
I have not tried to merge this section with the above, it would take too long and isn't worth
it, we can talk through anything you are not sure of !
</b>

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<p>The term "<CODE>View</CODE>" means a particular arrangement of fmap:
the window size, which columns are on/off, how the columns are configured and
so on. The <CODE>View</CODE> will be stored in a file so that subsequently it can be
loaded into the fmap to produce an individually customised "look and feel".

<p>Requirements for such <CODE>Views</CODE> include:

<dl>
  <dt><b>user specific -</b>
  <dd>Each user needs to have their own set of defaults.
  <dt><b>database specific -</b>
  <dd>should be able to have a specific <CODE>View</CODE> for a database
  <dt><b>interchangeable <CODE>Views</CODE> -</b>
  <dd>the user should be able to switch between <CODE>Views</CODE> while in fmap
  <dt><b>easy set up -</b>
  <dd>it should be simple for the user to create a <CODE>Views</CODE> by arranging
      an fmap in the way they would like and then saving that arrangement as a <CODE>View</CODE>
  <dt><b>editting of <CODE>Views</CODE> -</b>
  <dd>editting of a <CODE>View</CODE> should be as simple as displaying an fmap using
      the <CODE>View</CODE> to be editted, changing the <CODE>View</CODE> and then saving it. Its
      also important the the <CODE>View</CODE> should be saved as plain text to
      allow experienced users to "hand-edit" the file.
  <dt><b>location of <CODE>Views</CODE> -</b>
  <dd>by default the <CODE>Views</CODE> will be stored in the users home directory,
      but it should be possible to specify an alternative to this.
</dl>


<H3>Spec.</H3>

<p>This is an initial design based on the preceding requirements.


<H4>What should the <CODE>View</CODE> hold ?</H4>

<dl>
  <dt><b>fmap window size -</b>
  <dd>this can only be customised per database at the moment,
      the <CODE>View</CODE> will allow the user to specify a default size and position
      of their own.
  <dt><b>global flags -</b>
  <dd>these are flags that apply to the whole of fmap, such
      as "Preserve".
  <dt><b>column on/off -</b>
  <dd>the on/off state of all columns will be stored.
  <dt><b>column config -</b>
  <dd>will include "bumpable" setting etc.
</dl>

<H4>How will <CODE>Views</CODE> be stored ?</H4>

<P><CODE>Views</CODE> will be held in a subdirectory of the users home
directory called <b><code>.acedbrc</code></b>, this naming style is a
de-facto standard on Unix. This is also where current acedb user defaults
are held. (<b>NOTE</b> that <b><code>.acedbrc</code></b> is currently a file
so acedb code will have to be rewritten to recreate it as a directory and move the
existing <b><code>.acedbrc</code></b> into the directory.)

<P>The user will be able to have as many different views as they want,
each <CODE>View</CODE> will stored in its own subdirectory (probably a subdirectory, but maybe
just a file) of the <b><code>.acedbrc</code></b> subdirectory. Each <CODE>View</CODE> will be identified
by a unique name which will also be the name of the subdirectory so
<CODE>View</CODE> names will be limited to valid characters for filenames.
<CODE>View</CODE> names will be of the form <b><code>XXXXX.fmapview</code></b>.

<P>An alternative <CODE>View</CODE> directory can be specified either via an environment
variable or via a command line option to the acedb program.


<H4>How will <CODE>Views</CODE> be manipulated by the user ?</H4>

<P>The user will create new views by running xace on a database,
displaying the fmap, configuring the fmap and then using a new "Save View"
menu item to save the <CODE>View</CODE>.

<P>A particular <CODE>View</CODE> will be selected using a variant of the "File Chooser"
window to select the required <CODE>View</CODE>.

<P>Existing <CODE>Views</CODE> will be altered by selecting the <CODE>View</CODE>
from fmap, reconfiguring and resaving the <CODE>View</CODE>.

<P>The user will be able to make one particular <CODE>View</CODE> their
default <CODE>View</CODE> which will be used unless overidden in the way specified
below, this view will be called <code><b>DEFAULT.fmapview</b></code>.

<P>The user will be able to associate a <CODE>View</CODE> with a database when saving
the <CODE>View</CODE>. The <CODE>View</CODE> will be given the
name of the database as given by the "-t" field for _DDtMain in wspec/displays.wrm.
This still leaves the NAME option in wspec/database.wrm as a
changeable field for the curator to indicate different versions of a
database without invaliding the <CODE>View</CODE> to database mapping.

<P>Which <CODE>View</CODE> will be used by xace will be decided in this
order:
<ol>
  <li>The default <CODE>View</CODE>
  <li>the database specific <CODE>View</CODE>
  <li>a <CODE>View</CODE> specified by the $ACEDB_FMAP_VIEW environment variable
  <li>a <CODE>View</CODE> specified on the command line via the -fmapview flag
</ol>

<P>No blending of <CODE>Views</CODE> will be done, the code will simply
use the last name from the above list to identify which <CODE>View</CODE to load.
Note that the <CODE>View</CODE> finally loaded can subsequently be replaced
by an alternative from within fmap.


<H4>What format will <CODE>Views</CODE> be save in ?</H4>

<P>Since much of the column configuration data is already held in the form
of "<code>Method</code>" objects, <CODE>Views</CODE> will make use of this
and be stored as ace files. This will require an addition to the models
held by a database to include some kind of "fmap" model. This needs further
discussion, on the face there is no reason not to have an fmap model, we already
have method objects in the database, so why not an fmap object.

<P>Storing the <CODE>Views</CODE> as fmaps will allow experienced users to
hand-edit their <CODE>Views</CODE>. It also means that the existing acedb
parse code can very simply be used to read in a <CODE>View</CODE>.
