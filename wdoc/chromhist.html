<H1>Using the histogram features in Physical-Chromo-Map</H1>

<PRE>


Several people have asked how to use the facility in acedb to show
histograms of the chromosomal distribution of various items.  There is
in fact quite a flexible system for doing this, but it is a little
intricate to use.  I always have to relearn it myself whenever I use
it, so it seemed a good idea to write comprehensive instructions.

From a standard map display, go to "Physical Chromo Map" (the last
item on the menu).  From there choose "Full Genome Distribution".
With a worm database, you should now see the six chromosomes with
yellow bars for the physically mapped regions.  There are now two
relevant menu entries, "Create histogram from file" and "Create
histogram from keyset".

Create histogram from file
--------------------------

The file version is more flexible, so I will describe that first.  The
file must have the ending ".hisinf" to be read in by the program.  The
required format is

	CLONE_NAME [n] [len]

where n is the number of items in that cosmid, and len is its length.
The clone must be on the physical map for the information to register.
If n is missing it is assumed to be 1.  Multiple lines for the same
clone will add; this is fine for the n values, but the lengths also
add (unfortunately), so you should not have multiple lines per clone
if you give length information.  

You can create multiple histograms for a single window by reading in
multiple files.  For each data set, you get a little window that lets
you set a number of different parameters:

  Histogram bin: bin size in Mb (i.e. as on image scales).  Must be > 0.
    If you set the bin width to 0 you suppress the column, even in line
    mode.
  Width factor: Let us call this wfac. In histogram mode, if you gave
    lengths then the width of each block is wfac*ntot*1000000/lentot,
    i.e. wfac=1 shows the normalised number per Mb.  In a histogram
    without length information, the block width is wfac*ntot/binsize, 
    equivalent to assuming there is complete coverage of information
    in the bin (not a good assumption for sequence-based information!).
    In line mode, lengths are ignored, and the line size for each
    clone is wfac*n.
  Colour: acedb colour: 0=WHITE, 1=BLACK, 2=LIGHTGREY, 3=DARKGREY, 
    4=RED, 5=GREEN, 6=BLUE, etc.
  Offset: offset right of yellow bars, in character width units.
  Name: gets printed above the column for each chromosome.
  Is Line: 0 or 1 - 0 for a histogram, 1 for a line per clone

To see any effect after a change you must redraw the display with
"Full Genome Distribution".

If you quit the column specification window, you can get it back again
with "Edit histogram columns" from the menu.

Create histogram from keyset
----------------------------

The "from keyset" option makes a list from the active keyset.  It
takes all Clone objects that are either directly on the physical map,
or that are connected by a Positive tag2 relationship with clones on
the map, e.g. cDNA clones with hybridisation data.  Note that the
latter functionality is only available via the keyset option.  It then
works the same way as the file option without lengths.

Example
-------

There is an example file containing the number of CDS per cosmid from
in ~rd/worm.data/9510/cosmids.cds.hisinf:

  AH6 13 37801
  B0034 5 35228
  B0228 9 38946
  B0244 8 43546
  ...

Load this file, set (bin 1, wfac 0.02, colour 3, offset 0, name
"His", isline 0), and to see something.

Now load the same file again, and use (bin 1, wfac 0.5, colour 6,
offset 5, name "Line", isline 1) to see an example of line display.

You can vary the histogram width in histogram mode without changing
anything else.  If you set it very small, e.g. 0.1, you get something
that looks quite like the line display, but is in fact a little
different.

Make a keyset of all A* clones, load this with "Create histogram from
keyset" and set (bin 1, wfac 1, colour 4, offset 10, name "A*", isline
0).  This shows the chromosomal distribution of the 97 unburied Axxxx
clones.
