This is the acembly distribution directory. Acembly is a sequence
assembly package layered over acedb, so the source code includes
the whole acedb kernel, but not necessarilly all the peripheric
tools. The current release of the acedb code is version 4_2. 
 This directory should contain at least

README.acembly	  This file
NOTES		  Further notes - please get and read this file unless
			you know exactly what you want to do.
INSTALL.acembly	  The installation script 
USAGE             The minimal instruction set
ACEMBLY.*.tar.gz  The ACEMBLY tool box

  At least one of:
bin.*.tar.gz	  Machine dependant binaries.

  Optionally:
source.*          The acedb-kernel/acembly source code 
demo.*            Demos containing ABI trace files.
doc.*             More documentation.

Further information about acedb can be obtained via the bionet
newsgroup bionet.software.acedb, and from the documentation archive at
http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/acedocs/index.html.
