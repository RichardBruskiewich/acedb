Subject: Re:  how to make acedb fly

most important is to run the aceserver on a LOCAL disk
not nfs mounted and not on a RAID

actually LINUX gives impressive results because of its
excellent disk caching

=====

now aceperl is memory intensive and best is to run it on a 
separate machine so you do not swap out aceserver
swapping bits of aceperl is ok, this just slws down some clients

======

reading a big acefile is done in chuncks and should not too much degrade the
system

the worst case is some sort of queries

what i recommend for higehr performances is to index
as many tags as possible
my most recent code indexes all tags, that costs just a couple of Mb of ram
for the worm database and accelerates many requests

====

no task is really cpu intensive, we are really io bound
so best is to have very fast disk, and a large ram, like 512 M
so the disks are really cached in ram

====

i can send you the indexing fix for ace.4_7 if you wish
just 2 lines to edit in wnq/bindex.c than read-models


static void bIndexRegisterSecondaryTag(OBJ obj, int cc, BS bs, KEY masterTag)
{
  if(!bs) return ;
  if (bs->key == _UNIQUE)
    { bIndexRegisterSecondaryTag(obj, cc, bs->right, masterTag) ; return ; }
  if (bs->key == _XREF && bs->right)
    { bIndexRegisterSecondaryTag(obj, cc, bs->right->right, masterTag) ; return ;}
  if (class(bs->key) || 
      bs->key < _Date)
    return ;    /* break on values */
  if (bs->down)
    bIndexRegisterSecondaryTag(obj, cc, bs->down, masterTag) ;
  /* no condition, just index every tag */
  masterTag = bs->key ;


the fix is to remove the if which used to condition the line
  masterTag = bs->key ;


then read-models -index // forces reindexing
