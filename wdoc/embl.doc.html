 <H1> EMBL dumping documentation </H1>

 EMBL dump now gets information from a Method object, which controls
what is dumped where.  In fact, you can specify dump field information
either in the Sequence object itself, or a method, or a method
inherited from the method ..., i.e. you can have defaults that you
override either in a specialised method or in the object itself.
 <p>
 You can now dump any sequence object for which DNA can be found,
directly or indirectly (so you can dump links or subsequences).
 <p>
 You can also now dump from giface, including gifaceserver (see
example below).
 <p>
 There is now code for dumping arbitrary features according to dump
information in the feature method, plus possible #Feature_info data
from the Feature lines.  This also works on Homol lines now.

 <H3> Known bugs/incompletenesses: </H3>

 <ol>
 <li> I don't get arbitrary features from subsequences, and recurse on
them. So in fact dumping links won't work. I realise.
 <li> I should use methods on subsequences when dumping them
(partially done now; 980815).
 </ol>

<H2> Using EMBL_dump_info and associated methods </H2>

The order of processing the header information is:
<ol>
<li> Needs to be a sequence object.  Needs to find DNA.  
<li> Complains if no object under _Clone [clone].  This will be used
in the context of Clone_left_end information (see below).
<li> The ID entry is derived from _Database "EMBL" [id] [ac].  If it
exists then use [id].  Else use ID_template from the dump_info,
replacing %s by the sequence object name.
<li> AC lines are calculated from _Database "EMBL" [id] [ac].  If
that does not exist, look under _Ac_number [ac].  Else nothing.
<li> DE lines come from DE_format in dump_info.  %s is
substituted by the clone name if one exists, else the sequence name.
<li> KW lines come from _Keyword [keyword] entries.
<li> OS line from OS_line in method.
<li> OC lines from OC_lines in method.  It does not rewrap these so
you have to get the lines right.
<li> References.  Submission reference gets RA names from From_author
in the object, then Previous_author in the object; both can be
multiple. Fills RL line from RL_submission, relacing DD-MMM-YYYY with
the date obtained from Submitted in the object if that exists, else
the current date.  Then gets further references from the
EMBL_reference in the method, parsing fields out of the standard
Paper model.
<li> Gets CC lines from CC_line in the method.  Replace %s in these by
clone name, or object name if that does not exist.  Each CC_line text
will be wrapped and appear as a separate paragraph separated by a
blank XX line from the next paragraph.
<li> Writes standard CC lines.  First set of these give left and right
end information using Clone_left_end and Clone_right end info from the
clone for this object, and for other clones with ends in this
sequence.  The second set gives overlap information with neighbouring
sequences.
<li> Finally, write CC lines for explicit DB_remark entries from the
object itself.  These are also wrapped and separated into paragraphs
by XX lines.
</ol>

The feature table is written in the following order:
<ol>
<li> A source feature is written.  This uses source_organism from the
method to fill in /organism.  The clone name is given in /clone if
that exists.  The chromosome and map qualifiers are filled from
EMBL_chromosome and EMBL_map fields in the #EMBL_dump_info of the
sequence, if they are there.  If not, and there is a Map object for
the sequence, then it looks inside that for a Text entry following the
tag EMBL_chromosome, and if that is found, writes a /chromosome entry
containing it.
<li> Next it does the subsequences:
<ol>
<li>
Prior to 980915 it looks for tags CDS, mRNA, and text following tRNA,
snRNA, scRNA, misc_RNA and dumps accordingly.  For the latter ones
with text it produces a note containing the text, followed by "-tRNA"
or "-RNA".
<li>
From 980915, in order to be dumped, a subsequence must have a Method, and that
method must have an EMBL_feature, which specifies the feature key
used.  For pseudogenes use the key "CDS" (required by EMBL rules).
The RNA notes are filled in as before.
<li>
For CDS checks if translatable without a stop codon, and if not then
sets /pseudo qualifier and messerrors.  
<li>
Builds the location information, going across LINK boundaries.  Checks
for Start_not_found and End_not_found tags and uses greater than and
less than signs in these cases (but not /partial).  In these cases, it
sets codon_start where necessary.
<li>
If CDS_predicted_by a method, then dumps out /note="predicted using
%s".
<li>
If the name of the object ends in a lower case letter, then prints out
/note="preliminary prediction".  EBI recognises this, and puts the
resulting peptide into REM-TREMBL, not SP-TREMBL.
<li>
If a Locus attached then write /gene="{Locus}".  If gene_from_name was
set in the model, then it will also write out /gene="{object name}".
<li>
If a DB_remark attached to the object, then dump that as a note.  Else
if Brief_identification, dump /note="similar to {brief_id}".
<li>
For each sequence (normally an EST) attached via Matching_cDNA to the
object, we print a line saying "cDNA EST EMBL:%s comes from this gene"
or "cDNA EST %s comes from this gene" depending on whether we can find
an accession number.  40 lines per /note qualifier.
<li>
If find TSL_site followed by an integer, then write a line 
/note="Possible trans-spliced leader site at {position}".  Very worm
specific.
</ol>
<li> Next, Features and Homols are dumped as described in the text
below, if their methods have EMBL_dump information.
<li> Finally, the sequence itself is dumped as an SQ line followed by
sequence.
</ol>

<H3> Model Changes </H3>

Create a new # (subobject) model:
<pre>
#EMBL_dump_info	EMBL_dump_method UNIQUE ?Method
		ID_template UNIQUE Text	
		ID_division UNIQUE Text
		DE_format UNIQUE Text  
		OS_line UNIQUE Text    
		OC_line Text           
		RL_submission Text     
		EMBL_reference ?Paper  
		CC_line Text           
		source_organism UNIQUE Text   
		gene_from_name
		EMBL_chromosome UNIQUE Text
		EMBL_map UNIQUE Text
</pre>
 This information is made accessible by adding to the Method model:
 <pre>
	EMBL_dump_info #EMBL_dump_info
</pre>
 Add similarly to Sequence model:
 <pre>
	  DB_info	...
			EMBL_dump_info #EMBL_dump_info
</pre>
 The use of the shared subobject model makes things recursive.  When
looking for OS_line, for example, the first one that is found gets
used, starting with information in the Sequence object, then in its
EMBL_dump_method, then in its EMBL_dump_method...  
 <p>
 Add to Map model:
 <pre>
	EMBL_chromosome UNIQUE Text
</pre>
 This determines how a Map object is transformed to a /chromosome="xx"
line under the "source" feature key.

<H3> Models for dumping Features and Homols </H3>

<pre>
?Sequence ...
//	  Homol	<tag2> <object> ?Method Float Int UNIQUE Int Int UNIQUE Int #Homol_info
		// <object> is target, Float is score, second pair of

		  EMBL_threshold UNIQUE Float
			// apply to score unless overridden
		  EMBL_qualifier Text UNIQUE Text
	  // if 1 Text, it is the entire qualifier including '/'
	  // if 2 Texts, 1st is an sprintf format and 2nd is
	  //   an argument.  If this is "score", "note", "y1", "y2" or "target"
	  //   then use the corresponding field of the Feature or Homol line.
	  // multiple formats will be concatenated until one starts with '/'.

#Feature_info	EMBL_dump UNIQUE EMBL_dump_YES
				 EMBL_dump_NO
			// overrides for embl dump based on method
		EMBL_qualifier Text
			// additional to those in the method, includes '/'
		...

// #Homol_info can have all the same content as ?Feature_info

CC   Current sequence finishing criteria for the C. elegans genome
CC   sequencing consortium are that all bases are either sequenced
CC   unambiguously on both strands, or on a single strand with both
CC   a dye primer and dye terminator reaction, from distinct
CC   subclones.  Exceptions are indicated by an explicit note.
CC   
CC   Coding sequences below are predicted from computer analysis,
CC   using predictions from Genefinder (P. Green, U. Washington),
CC   and other available information.
CC   
CC   IMPORTANT:  This sequence is NOT necessarily the entire insert
CC   of the specified clone.  It may be shorter because we only
CC   sequence overlapping sections once, or longer because we
CC   arrange for a small overlap between neighbouring submissions.
CC   
CC   The true left end of clone AH6 is at 1 in this sequence.
CC   The true right end of clone AH6 is at 3246 in

CC   The true left end of clone F35H8 is at 37686 in this sequence.
CC   The true right end of clone R134 is at 30025 in this sequence.
CC   The start of this sequence (1..101) overlaps with the end of
