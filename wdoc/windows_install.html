<H2> Packaging an Acedb database for easy installation on
windows. </H2>

The aim is to make a single executable file which can be distributed
by FTP, and easily installed on a computer running windows. The
installation process involves unpacking all the files comprising the
database and creating start-menu and desktop icons which will open the
database. 
<p>
Note that this archive does not include the Acedb programs. These
should be installed from a suitable installable archive before
installing any databases.

<H3>Tools</H3>

You will need to download and install "Inno Setup" available from 

<A HREF=http://www.jordanr.dhs.org/isinfo.htm>http://www.jordanr.dhs.org/isinfo.htm</A>

<H3>Control File</H3>
Inno Setup uses script files to control how it creates the program
archive. Below is an example with commentary on how to customise it
for your needs. The script files have names ending in .iss You can
edit them either on Inno Setup or using the text editor of your
choice. <font color=red>Red</font> text is things you'll probably want
to change. <font color=green>Green</font> text is my comments, don't
include that in your control file.

AppName=<font color=red>MyDatabase</font>    <font color=green> Used to name the program in the install wizard. </font>
AppVerName=<font color=red>MyDataBase</font>   <font color=green> Used to name the program in the install wizard. </font>
DefaultGroupName=<font color=red>Acedb Databases</font> <font color=green> The group in the start menu where the database will be installed. </font>
DefaultDirName=<font color=red>{sd}\Acedb Databases\MyDatabase</font> <font color=green> Where the files will be installed when the archive is installed - {sd} means system disk. </font> 
MinVersion=4,4
OutputBaseFileName=<font color=red>MyDatabase</font> <font color=green> The archive will be called MyDatabase.exe </font>
OutputDir=<font color=red>e:\</font> <font color=green> Where to put the finished archive. </font>
SourceDir=<font color=red>e:\dbDir</font>; <font color=green>Where to look for the files specified in [Files] below.</font> 

[Files]
Source: <font color=red>"database\*";</font> DestDir: "{app}\<font color=red>database</font>"; <font color=green> Include all the files you want here. </font>

[ini]
Filename: "{app}\<font color=red>MyDatabase</font>.adb"; Section: "ACEDB"; Key: "path"; String: "{app}"; <font color=green> This creates the .adb file used in [Icons} below. </font>

[Icons]
<font color=green>Line below makes an entry in the start menu in the sub-menu specified by DefaultGroupName.</font>
Name: "{group}\<font color=red>MyDatabase</font>"; Filename:"{app}\<font color=red>MyDatabase</font>.adb"  
<font color=green>Line below makes an icon on the desktop.</font>
Name: "{userdesktop}\<font color=red>MyDatabase</font>"; Filename: "{app}\<font color=red>MyDatabase</font>.adb"

<font color=green>Don't change the section below or the uninstall function may not work.</font>

</PRE>

Once you have the correct control file, save it using the File/Save
menu, and then hit File/Compile. Inno Setup will grind through its
stuff and you will end up with a single .exe file which when executed
will install your database. Copy that to your FTP site and then go and have a nice
cup of tea.

<H2> Making a CDROM. </H2>

Once you have an install-archive of your database it is quite simple
to go on and make a CD-ROM which allows for automatic installation of
both Acedb and you database with only a few clicks. The recommended
strategy is to make a CD containing three files.
<ul>

<li> The relevant install archive for Acedb itself, as distributed by
the Acedb Team.

<li> The install archive for your database, created by following the
instructions above.

<li> A small master installer, which guides the user through
installing first Acedb, and then your database.

</ul>

If you call the master installer Setup.exe, then windows will
even run it automatically when the user inserts the CD-ROM.
<p>
To create the master installer, use Inno Setup, in the way
described above, with a control file which looks like this.

<pre>
[Setup]
Bits=32
AppName=<font color=red>C Elegans Database CDROM</font>
AppVerName=<font color=red>the 7th January 2000 beta release</font>
CreateAppDir=0
MinVersion=4,4
OutputDir=.
OutputBaseFileName=Setup
InfoBeforeFile=<font color=red>cdromblurb.txt</font>
Uninstallable=0

[Run]
Filename: "{src}\<font color=red>Acedb-4_8c.exe</font>"; Parameters: "/SP-";
Filename: "{src}\<font color=red>MyDatabase.exe</font>"; Parameters: "/SP-";

</pre>

Compiling the  above with Inno Setup will create Setup.exe, which will in turn run Acedb-4_8c.exe
and MyDatabase.exe from the CD-ROM. 
<p>
The file cdromblurb.txt contains
text which is displayed to the user as part of the install
process. Note that this is copied into Setup.exe when you compile the
control file with Inno Setup, so it needs to be available then: it
does not have to be on the CD-ROM. Here is an example I used, customise
it as necessary.

<pre>
Welcome to the C. elegans Acedb database CD-ROM distribution.

This installation program will install both the Acedb software
and, when that is complete, the C. Elegans database. If you wish 
to install only one of these components (for instance if you
already have the Acedb software installed) then click the 
Cancel button now and use the separate installation programs 
on this CD-ROM

Acedb.exe - to install the acedb software.
Wormace.exe - to install the C. Elegans data.

If you wish to install both components, click the next button,
which will take you first through installing the Acedb 
software, and then the C. Elegans data.
</pre>

Burn Setup.exe, the Acedb installer, and your database installer onto
a CD-ROM and all is complete. Inno Setup compresses the data, so even
rather large databases will fit on a single CD-ROM. If you database is
too large, Inno setup has a spanning feature to
allow it to be spread over more than one CD-ROM. See the documentation
which comes with Inno Setup for details on this.
