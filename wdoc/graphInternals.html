<H1> Programmers' guide to graph package internals </H1>


<H2>Overview</H2>
This document describes various aspects to graph package internals.
It is intended to be updated each time some new bit of design is done, some
new facility is added, or some old part is better documented. It is meant
to be a place where the graph package developer can go and look up how/why
bits of the graph package are the way they are. Each design section should have
a separate header and be cross referenced to other sections where appropriate.


<H2>The busy cursor</H2>
When windows are displayed on the screen we want to be able to tell the user that
the application is busy and they should not try to interact with it. The easiest
way to do this is to change the mouse pointer (aka 'cursor') to a watch shape, this
has become a de-facto standard for saying the application is busy. The original graph
package interface was through a single call, <CODE>graphBusyCursorAll</CODE>, which
was intended to display a busy cursor on all acedb windows. The intention was that
the application code or the graph package could show this cursor when required.

<P>
To avoid the application having to know when to turn cursors on/off the busy cursors
were shown every time an Xevent was dispatched, the intention being that an event dispatch
would often mean some significant work was being done by the application.
This method had two major flaws:
<OL>
  <LI>It meant a large number of extra requests to the server every time
       an event was dispatched, whether that event resulted in significant work or not.
  <LI>It did not work properly in that any new window which took a long time to construct
       would not have a busy cursor because no event processing (and hence no cursor setting)
       could be done while the window was being constructed.
</OL>
The excess number of extra requests often resulted in annoying cursor flashing when links
between X server & client were slow.

<P>
To get round this problem the way cursors are set on/off was changed.


<H4>The busy cursor implementation</H4>
We would like busy cursors to be shown whenever the application has sufficient work to do that
it cannot respond to the users interactions. In acedb graphical applications this includes:
<UL>
  <LI>graph creation
  <LI>potentially all application code callback routines
  <LI>graph redraw/resize
</UL>
The obvious places to put busy cursor calls are in the graph creation, redraw, resize routines
and in the set of graph routines that deal with events as these routines are the ones that
call the applications callback routines. There are several problems with doing this:
<OL>
  <LI>unfortunately there is no one 'layer' of the graph package that contains these calls
  <LI>more seriously, some of the routines that respond to events then set up another layer
       of callbacks which will then go on the do the serious work, e.g. the menu routines
       set up callbacks that will then call the applications callback routines once the user
       has selected an item from the menu.
  <LI>sometimes routines start an action that will only be completed some time later by a
       registered callback (this happens with graph creation).
  <LI>some application callbacks or graph callbacks are called often and for a very short
       time so setting a busy cursor would not be appropriate, e.g. in text entry boxes.
</OL>
Fortunately these problems can be solved in a reasonably satisfactory way, the following sections
detail what was done.

<H4>Graph layers and where to put the calls</H4>
Places where busy cursors must be set on/off are restricted to just a few places:
<UL>
  <LI>The routine where a window is created
  <LI>The points where application callbacks are called, these points are identified
       by code of the form: <CODE>(*gActive->func[*****])() ;</CODE>, where <CODE>*****</CODE>
       is the type of callback.
  <LI>The routines dealing with window redraw/resize
</UL>
busy cursor calls were added to:
<PRE><CODE>
w2/graphcon.c:  graphCreate
w2/graphsub.c:  gLeftDown, gMiddleDown, 
w2/graphxlib.c: graphClipDraw
w2/graphxt.c:   resizeCall, mouseCall, keyboardCall
w2/xtsubs.c:    freeMenuSelect, oldMenuSelect
</CODE></PRE>
Although calls have had to be added at conceptually 3 layers, at least the number
of calls is small (11 on/off pairs of busy cursor setting). This exercise reveals that
the layering in the graph package has broken down, there is no fixed layer that just
contains graph interface calls, the graph interface calls are embedded throughout the
graph code.


<H4>Graph creation</H4>
Whenever a new graph is built this happens in several phases:
<OL>
  <LI>create graph structures and display a blank window
  <LI>call an application callback to stack up drawing requests to the window
  <LI>call the graph redisplay function to actually draw into the window
</OL>     
We want the user to see the cursor go on at the beginning of the phases and go off at the end.
In this case we are lucky because all new windows are created by one routine and are drawn
by one routine, we can thus turn on the busy cursor in <CODE>graphCreate</CODE> and then
turn it off again in <CODE>graphClipDraw</CODE>. In fact in <CODE>graphClipDraw</CODE> the
busy cursor is turned and then turned off but no harm is done by turning on the busy cursor
twice.

<H4>Graph resize/redisplay</H4>
Both resize and redisplay happen in two phases:
<OL>
  <LI>call an application callback to either recalculate and stack up drawing requests to the window
       (for a resize), or to do any updating for redisplay
  <LI>call the graph redisplay/resize function to actually size/draw into the window
</OL>
These activties happen in just two routines: <CODE>resizeCall, graphClipDraw</CODE>. In fact
<CODE>resizeCall</CODE> does not do any drawing, it leaves that to <CODE>graphClipDraw</CODE>,
resizing is just a special case of redrawing.


<H4>Setting busy cursors for application callbacks</H4>
At first site the obvious place is to put calls in the all of the graph routines that
are callback routines for windows (generally called <CODE><B>nnnnn</B>Call</CODE> and
mostly defined in <CODE>graphxt.c</CODE>, see the translation tables).
But this is not always correct because these routines sometimes just register routines
to be called later so showing a busy cursor would be inappropriate:
<UL>
  <LI>in <CODE>pickCall</CODE> and <CODE>middleCall</CODE> the busy cursor needs to be set
       in routines they call directly
  <LI><CODE>menuCall</CODE> just posts a menu, it's in the general callback that gets called when
       when a menu item is selected that we need the busy cursor
  <LI>in <CODE>mouseCall</CODE> and <CODE>resizeCall</CODE> the busy cursor is set directly the routine
</UL>
The solution to finding where to put the busy cursor calls was to look for where
the application callbacks where actually called from rather than in the graph callbacks
themselves. This was easy to do because the application callbacks are all kept in an
array called <CODE>func</CODE> which is part of the graph structure. Searching through the
code produced a very places where the application callbacks were invoked which all
looked like this:

<PRE><CODE>
        (*gActive->func[*****])() ;
</CODE></PRE>

All calls like this were bracketed with the calls to turn on/off the busy cursor, e.g.

<PRE><CODE>
  if (isResize && gActive->func[RESIZE])
    {
    graphBusyCursorAll (TRUE);

    (*gActive->func[RESIZE])() ;

    graphBusyCursorAll (FALSE) ;
    }
</CODE></PRE>


<H4>Dealing with application callbacks that don't need a busy cursor</H4>
Some application and graph callbacks should not have a busy cursor associated with them,
a good example of this is <CODE>keyboardCall</CODE> in  <CODE>graphxt.c</CODE>.
We don't really want a busy cursor to shown for every key press, e.g.
just typing letters, so no busy cursor should be set in this routine for these key presses.
Unfortunately it is not enough to just not  
do the busy cursor call here because every key press also causes an expose handler to be  
called, the expose handler calls the redraw code which correctly shows the busy cursor !!
To avoid polluting the redraw routine, I've added a call to the busy cursor routines that will     
make the normal busy cursor call do nothing. This should be used with
care and in paired calls to start/stop disabling (as below) otherwise
the busy cursor stuff will get completely screwed up. This allows us to selectively stop
the normal busy cursor calls from doing anything when needs be:
<PRE><CODE>
  if (kval && gActive->func[KEYBOARD])
    {
    if (((keysym >= XK_KP_Space) && (keysym <= XK_KP_9))    /* Keypad keys */
	|| ((keysym >= XK_space) && (keysym <= XK_asciitilde)) /* normal keyboard keys */
	|| keysym == XK_BackSpace || keysym == XK_Delete    /* delete keys */
	|| keysym == XK_Left || keysym == XK_Right)	    /* left/right arrow keys */
      graphSetBusyCursorInactive(TRUE) ;

    graphBusyCursorAll (TRUE);

    (*gActive->func[KEYBOARD])(kval, modifier) ;

    graphBusyCursorAll (FALSE) ;

    graphSetBusyCursorInactive(FALSE) ;
    }
</CODE></PRE>
A caveat to the above code is that the above works because the expose handler is called in between
the cursor setting calls, this may not happen for other sections of code and may not even be
guaranteed to happen here, careful experimentation is required.

<P>
A more serious caveat to the current implementation of selective busy cursor setting in
the keyboard callback is that I have done this generally for <B>ALL</B> keyboard input,
assuming that no other part of the code has done something like set a translation for a
common letter such as "q" that launches some long running bit of code. If this happened
the application would be locked up with a busy cursor. It would be possible to add the busy
cursor calls to the text entry routines but this is not nearly so clean.


<H4>Summary</H4>
The busy cursor is now only set on and off when the application is doing significant work, it is
not set on/off repeatedly as it used to be. Text entry/deletion is now possible without the
flickering cursor. The busy cursor calls have only had to be added to the graph package in
about 10 places and this is entirely internal to the graph package thus maintaining the system
that the application code need not be responsible for this.
