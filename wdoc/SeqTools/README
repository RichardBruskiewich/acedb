This directory contains documentation for the set of sequence tools originally written
by Eric Sonnehammer. The tools are distributed as part of the acedb package because
a large part of them were written by Eric when he worked at the Sanger.

The documents are very incomplete but it's start. They are needed because while use
of acedb is declining usage of belvu, blixem and dotter continues by many groups
including Havana, Pfam and many others.
