/* 
 This grammar is taken from the document bnf.4,received from rd  oct 22

 I made a few modif:
 $= set definition, i think all set operations must be $prefixed
   it is better for the parser and also for the human user
 {} i use this notation to create a cleant_list
   of course, these were the conventions of the old system
   but i d like to preserve them.
 * had a double meaning, i denote the default identifier as .>
 : had a double meaning, i denote the field name tokenizer as ::
 DATE i add this function to parse date_literrals as DATE("date_litteral")
   in old system, to parse anything as date creates problem because nearly
   anything can possibly be a date. At the same time, the "" prevents
   parsing of embedded . and -
 ID  i am not sure i understand it, but i do not mind
 -> [] # .   I think they do differ and have this precedence order

 This definition of the pass1 is very terse, as usual in acedb, but already
 quite complete, fully parenthesize the expression, and checks bindings.
 The pass2 still has to check that the resulting tree is meaningful
  for example that you only multiply numbers by numbers
 The pass3 should be model dependant and check for existence of class names
  and the possibility to cast the acedb_data into the requested types

/* PASS1 of the query compiler runs as follows:
   - Fundamental types (int, float, "text") are recognize,
   - Existing () {} [] are tokenised recursivelly
   - The right most strongest operator, according to the following
    precedence list, is found,
   - It is bound to its neighbours according to its BINDING type
   - An error is reported if the binding is not optional but we hit 
    a closed parenthese or a ; or the end
   - bound to its neighbours and () the compound
   - PASS1 ends when the strongest operator is weaker than LAST_ATOM
