Description of make system used for acedb code.
===============================================

Introduction
------------
This file describes various aspects of the make system used for acedb.
Use this file to explain things rather than cluttering up the makefiles
themselves.





Libraries
---------

The recommended order of object files/libraries for linking is:


cc -o <exename>  <acedb object files> <OEM libraries> <system libraries>

The variable LIBS should be used in the _DEF files to specify the OEM and system
libraries.

This order minimises problems with unresolved symbols but does impose the penalty
that acedb files must not supply external symbols with the same name as those
in the OEM and system libraries. If this happens the acedb symbol will override
the library symbol to produce in the worst case subtle bugs.

(Note that the aims of minimising unresolved symbol errors and minimising problems
with duplicate symbols clash, they require oppposite orderings. It is up to us
to make sure we don't duplicate existing library symbols and use (where possible)
linker warnings to tell us about this.)
