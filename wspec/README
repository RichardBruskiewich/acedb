This is the wspec of the nematode C.elegans dataset
We copied it in the source code for our convenience
and because it uses nearly all the acedb features
but remember that it is a rather complex example

None of this file is used at compile time
There a read in  when you initialise a database,
when you issue a Read-Models command from xace or tace.

The passwd.wrm file is consulted when you want write acccess.
The fonts files when needed.

All of these files are (supposed to be) self documented.
