 *
 * Description: This code reports the version of the ACEDB code, this
 *              has the following implications:
 *
 *              - The code will only read databases that report the
 *                same major version from the super block held in the
 *                database.
 *              - The code will write databases that have in their
 *                super block the major/minor/update levels from this
 *                file.
 *              - The version is the overall version of the acedb code
 *                as a whole, not the version of any one library.
 *              - This is the version that most users will talk about
 *                and understand.
 *
 *              See aceversion.h for more description of the interface,
 *              and wdoc/version.html for further information on
 *              version numbers.

 *
 * HISTORY:
 * Last edited: Jan 13 10:01 2011 (edgrif)
 * * Mar  5 09:36 1999 (edgrif): Removed "Version" from the version string,
 *              Jean and Richard don't like it.
 * * Jan 12 16:15 1999 (fw): version 4_8 is now used for development trunk after 
 *              release of 4_7b to the users. This means that executables
 *              carrying the 4_8 stamp are known to be our development code,
 *              whereas 4_7b code is a user-release.
 * * Dec 10 13:29 1998 (edgrif): Add comments to allow automatic extraction
 *              of version data from this file by a perl script.
 * * Dec  3 10:42 1998 (edgrif): Change around some calls/names to fit in with
 *              acelib naming convention & support new version reporting.
 * * Oct 27 15:26 1998 (edgrif): Replace malloc with messalloc, redo error messages,
 *              they replicated the messcrash macro.
 * *  (done by il at some time): added i to string_len for the /0 character and 
 *              sizeof(char) so that no memory errors on SGI/SUN.
